1. Medicare covers injectable osteoporosis drugs if you're a woman with osteoporosis and qualify for the Medicare home health benefit.
2. Coverage is granted only if you've had a bone fracture certified by a doctor as being related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
3. Coverage applies if your doctor confirms that you cannot administer the injection yourself or learn how to self-administer the drug.
4. Medicare will also cover the cost of a home health nurse or aide to provide the injection if family members or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug.
