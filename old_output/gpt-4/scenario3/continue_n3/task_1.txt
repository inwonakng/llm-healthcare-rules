1. Medicare will cover the cost of transplant drug therapy if they contributed to the payment for your organ transplant.
2. You must have Part A during the time of the approved transplant.
3. You also must have Part B when receiving immunosuppressive drugs.
4. If Part B does not cover these drugs, Medicare drug coverage, known as Part D, can cover them. 
5. If you are with Original Medicare, you have the option of joining a Medicare drug plan to acquire drug coverage.
6. If your Medicare is solely due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), the coverage offered, including that for immunosuppressive drugs, will terminate 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
7. Medicare provides a benefit to aid those who lose Part A coverage 36 months post kidney transplant and lack specific other health coverages (such as a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid covering immunosuppressive drugs).
8. This benefit is strictly for covering the cost of your immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services. It is not a replacement for comprehensive health coverage.
9. You are eligible to apply to this benefit at any point after your Part A coverage ceases. To register, contact Social Security at 1-877-465-0355 (TTY users can use 1-800-325-0788).
10. In 2023, for the immunosuppressive drug benefit, the monthly premium will be $97.10* and $226 deductible if you enlist.
11. Once your deductible is paid, you will be responsible for 20% of the Medicare-approved cost for your immunosuppressive drugs.
