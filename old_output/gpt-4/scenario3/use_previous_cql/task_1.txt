1. Medicare provides coverage for transplant drug therapy, provided Medicare contributed to the payment for your organ transplant.
2. You must possess Part A during the covered transplant and Part B when you receive immunosuppressive drugs.
3. If Part B does not cover the immunosuppressive drugs, Medicare drug coverage (Part D) will instead cover them.
4. Enrollment in a Medicare drug plan is necessary to receive Medicare drug coverage if you have Original Medicare.
5. If you have Medicare solely because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your comprehensive Medicare coverage, inclusive of immunosuppressive drug coverage, will terminate 36 months post a successful kidney transplant.
6. Medicare offers a benefit that may assist you, in case you lose Part A coverage 36 months post a kidney transplant and lack certain other types of health coverage (e.g., a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid covering immunosuppressive drugs).
7. This benefit is limited to covering your immunosuppressive drugs and excludes other items or services. It should not be considered a replacement for comprehensive health coverage.
8. If eligible, registration for this benefit can occur at any time post the termination of your Part A coverage. For registration, call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can dial 1-800-325-0788.
9. Starting 2023, subscribing to the immunosuppressive drug benefit entails a monthly premium of $97.10* and a $226 deductible. After meeting the deductible, 20% of the Medicare-approved amount will be your responsibility for your immunosuppressive drugs.
