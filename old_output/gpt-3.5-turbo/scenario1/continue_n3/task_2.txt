Logic Rules expressed in N3 syntax:

1. A patient who is female and has osteoporosis and meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit and has a bone fracture and is certified by a doctor and cannot self-administer and cannot learn to self-administer and has family or caregivers who are unable or unwilling to administer the injection, is eligible for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs.
2. If a patient meets all the conditions mentioned in the first rule, the decision for coverage for injectable osteoporosis drugs is true.
