Summary: Medicare covers transplant drug therapy for individuals who have received an organ transplant and have Medicare coverage. The coverage includes immunosuppressive drugs and can be obtained through Part B or Part D. However, if the individual has Medicare only due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), the coverage for immunosuppressive drugs ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant. There is a benefit offered by Medicare to help individuals who lose Part A coverage after 36 months, but it only covers immunosuppressive drugs and not other health services. The premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit in 2023 is $97.10 per month, with a $226 deductible. Once the deductible is met, individuals will pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for immunosuppressive drugs.
