Summary:
Medicare provides coverage for transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for the organ transplant. Part A is required at the time of the covered transplant and Part B is required at the time of receiving immunosuppressive drugs. If Part B doesn't cover immunosuppressive drugs, they can be covered under Part D. If you have Original Medicare, you can join a Medicare drug plan for drug coverage. However, if you have Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant. Medicare offers a benefit for immunosuppressive drugs if you lose Part A coverage after 36 months and do not have other health coverage. This benefit only covers immunosuppressive drugs and can be signed up for after Part A coverage ends. The premium in 2023 for this benefit is $97.10 per month with a $226 deductible. After meeting the deductible, you'll pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for immunosuppressive drugs.
