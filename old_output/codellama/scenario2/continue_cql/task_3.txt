Here is a Solidity smart contract that implements the requirements described in the natural language text:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareCoverage {
    struct Patient {
        bool isCovered;
        bool isEligible;
        bool isPrimaryCoverage;
        bool isSecondaryCoverage;
        address primaryProvider;
        address secondaryProvider;
        uint256 paymentAmount;
    }

    function isCovered(Patient patient) public view returns (bool) {
        return patient.isCovered;
    }

    function isEligible(Patient patient) public view returns (bool) {
        return patient.isEligible;
    }

    function isPrimaryCoverage(Patient patient) public view returns (bool) {
        return patient.isPrimaryCoverage;
    }

    function isSecondaryCoverage(Patient patient) public view returns (bool) {
        return patient.isSecondaryCoverage;
    }

    function calculatePaymentAmount(Patient patient) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return patient.paymentAmount;
    }
}
```
In this contract, we define a `Patient` struct that encapsulates the necessary parameters to determine the patient's Medicare coverage. The struct includes booleans to represent whether the patient is covered and eligible, and whether they have primary or secondary coverage. It also includes the addresses of the primary and secondary providers, as well as the payment amount.

The contract includes four functions that correspond to the natural language text: `isCovered`, `isEligible`, `isPrimaryCoverage`, and `isSecondaryCoverage`. Each function takes a `Patient` struct as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the patient meets the respective condition.

The `calculatePaymentAmount` function takes a `Patient` struct as input and returns the payment amount as a `uint256`.

The input to the contract is a `Patient` struct that includes the necessary parameters to determine the patient's Medicare coverage. The output of the contract is a boolean indicating whether the patient is covered and eligible, and a payment amount.

The contract's functionality is based on the requirements outlined in the natural language text. The contract takes into account the patient's coverage status, eligibility, and payment amount, and it returns a boolean indicating whether the patient is covered and eligible, and a payment amount.
