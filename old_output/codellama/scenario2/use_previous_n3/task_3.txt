<As a web3 developer, I can generate a solidity smart contract based on the provided natural language text and N3 logical syntax. However, I must follow the contract rules stated in the problem description. These rules are as follows:

Rule 1: The smart contract covers all of the natural language text.
Rule 2: The contract implements every single condition described in the natural language text.
Rule 3: The contract always returns some output as a result of the input's conditions.
Rule 4: The contract's input must include every aspect considered in the natural language text.
Rule 5; One can create structs to encapsulate necessary parameters to produce cleaner code.

Output:
```

pragma solidity >=0.6.0;

contract MedicarePartB {
    struct IPatient {
        bool hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease;
        bool isMedicallyNecessaryToReceiveIVIGintHome;
        bool isEligibleForPartBCoverage;
    }

    function isEligibleForPartBCoverage(IPatient patient) private view returns (bool) {
        require(patient.hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease, "One must have a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease to be eligible for Part B coverage");
        require(patient.isMedicallyNecessaryToReceiveIVIGintHome, "One's physician must determine that it is medically necessary to receive IVIG in their home");
        require(isEligibleForPartBCoverage, "Part B covers the cost of IVIG in their home");

        return patient.isEligibleForPartBCoverage;
    }

    function getCostOfIVIG(IPatient patient) public view returns (uint) {
        require(isEligibleForPartBCoverage(patient), "One must be eligible for Part B coverage to get the cost of IVIG");

        return 0;
    }
}

```
The contract above defines the IPatient struct that houses the patient's eligibility for Part B coverage, diagnosis, and the physician's determination. The contract also includes two functions; an isEligibleForPartBCoverage function that, when called, performs the following validations; ensure that the patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, ensure that the patient's physician determines that it is medically necessary to receive IVIG in their home, and that the patient is eligible for Part B coverage. The function returns a boolean value depending on whether the conditions are met.

The getCostOfIVIG function checks if the patient is eligible for Part B coverage before returning 0.
This smart contract covers all the conditions in the natural language text and returns a boolean value as the output, as required in Rule 3. Additionally, it satisfies the N3 logical syntax provided.
