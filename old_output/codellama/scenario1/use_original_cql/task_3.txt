To create a solidity smart contract that covers all aspects of the natural language text, we need to identify the key elements and conditions mentioned in the text. Based on the information provided, we can identify the following:

1. The contract should cover injectable osteoporosis drugs for eligible women with post-menopausal osteoporosis who need assistance with self-administration.
2. The contract should include the following conditions:
a. The woman must meet the criteria for Medicare home health benefit.
b. She must have a bone fracture certified by a doctor to be related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
c. Her doctor must certify that she cannot give herself the injection or learn how to give herself the drug by injection.
d. Medicare will cover the home health nurse or aide to provide the injection if her family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to give her the drug by injection.
3. The contract should have the following inputs:
a. The woman's eligibility for Medicare home health benefit.
b. Her bone fracture diagnosis and certification by a doctor.
c. Her doctor's certification that she cannot give herself the injection or learn how to give herself the drug by injection.
d. The availability of a home health nurse or aide to provide the injection.

Based on these elements and conditions, we can create a solidity smart contract that covers all aspects of the natural language text.

Here is an example of a solidity smart contract that meets the requirements:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.10;

contract InjectableOsteoporosisDrugs {
    // Define the structs for the inputs
    struct Woman {
        address womanAddress;
        bool isMedicareEligible;
        bool hasBoneFracture;
        bool cannotSelfAdminister;
    }

    struct HomeHealthNurse {
        address homeHealthNurseAddress;
        bool isAvailable;
    }

    // Define the events for the outputs
    event WomanEligible(address indexed womanAddress);
    event WomanIneligible(address indexed womanAddress);
    event BoneFractureDetected(address indexed womanAddress);
    event NoBoneFractureDetected(address indexed womanAddress);
    event injectionProvided(address indexed womanAddress);

    // Define the functions for the contract
    function eligible(Woman memory woman) public {
        // Check if the woman is eligible for Medicare home health benefit
        if (woman.isMedicareEligible) {
            // Check if the woman has a bone fracture and it is certified by a doctor
            if (woman.hasBoneFracture) {
                // Check if the woman's doctor certifies that she cannot give herself the injection or learn how to give herself the drug by injection
                if (woman.cannotSelfAdminister) {
                    // Check if there is a home health nurse or aide available to provide the injection
                    if (HomeHealthNurse.isAvailable) {
                        // Inject the woman with the drug
                        injectionProvided(woman.womanAddress);
                    } else {
                        // Indicate that there is no home health nurse or aide available to provide the injection
                        noHomeHealthNurseAvailable(woman.womanAddress);
                    }
                } else {
                    // Indicate that the woman cannot self-administer the injection
                    cannotSelfAdminister(woman.womanAddress);
                }
            } else {
                // Indicate that the woman does not have a bone fracture
                noBoneFractureDetected(woman.womanAddress);
            }
        } else {
            // Indicate that the woman is not eligible for Medicare home health benefit
            womanIneligible(woman.womanAddress);
        }
    }

    // Define the getter functions for the contract
    function getWoman(address womanAddress) public view returns (Woman memory) {
        return Woman(womanAddress, true, true, true);
    }

    function getHomeHealthNurse(address homeHealthNurseAddress) public view returns (HomeHealthNurse memory) {
        return HomeHealthNurse(homeHealthNurseAddress, true);
    }
}
```
This contract includes the structs for the Woman and HomeHealthNurse, as well as the functions to check if the woman is eligible and to provide the injection (if available). The contract also includes the getter functions to retrieve the woman and home health nurse information.

Please note that this is just an example and you should consult with a qualified legal expert before implementing any smart contract.
