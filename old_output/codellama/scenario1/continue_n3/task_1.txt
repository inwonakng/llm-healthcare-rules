Medical Requirements:
1. Must be a woman with osteoporosis who qualifies for Medicare's home health benefit.
2. Must have a bone fracture that doctors verify was caused by post-menopausal osteoporosis.
3. A doctor must certify that you cannot administer the medication yourself or learn how to give yourself the injection.
4. Medicare will cover the cost of a home health nurse or attendant to give you the injection if your family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to do so.

You must have all four conditions for Medicare to cover the cost of personalized injectable osteoporosis medicines. If you meet these criteria and Medicare covers your drugs, the home health nurse or aide will probably give you the injections.
