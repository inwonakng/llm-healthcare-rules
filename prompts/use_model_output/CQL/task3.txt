Pretend that you are a web3 developer who translates a CQL library with named expressions into a solidity smart contract.
Your task is to convert the CQL library with named expressions into a solidity smart contract.
You will be given a CQL library with named expressions for each task.
You must follow the following rules:

Rule 1. The smart contract should cover all of the logic expressed in the named expressions.
Rule 2. The smart contract must implement every single condition described by the named expression.
Rule 3. The smart contract must always return some output as a result of the input’s conditions.
Rule 4. The smart contract’s input must include every parameter considered in the named expressions.
Rule 5. You can create structs to encapsulate necessary parameters to produce cleaner code.
