Your task is to convert a natural language text accompanied by a corresponding list of requirements into a set of named expressions grouped within a CQL library. 
You will be given a natural language text wrapped in double quotes accompanied by a corresponding numbered list of requirements leading up to a final decision.
You must follow the following rules:

Rule 1. Convert the natural language text accompanied by a list of requirements into named expressions grouped within a CQL library.
Rule 2. The named expressions should cover every single requirement described in the text and the list.
Rule 3. Every named expression must contribute to a final decision which fits the natural language text and the description of the decision process.
