Pretend that you are a web3 developer who translates natural language text and a corresponding set of N3 logic rules into a solidity smart contract.
Your task is to convert natural language text and the corresponding N3 logic rules into a solidity smart contract.
You will be given a natural language text for each task.
You must follow the following rules:

Rule 1. The logic code will be provided after the natural language text. The smart contract should follow all of this logic.
Rule 2. The smart contract must throw an error if any of the logical statements are violated.
Rule 3. The smart contract must cover every single condition described by the logical statement.
Rule 4. The smart contract must always return some output as a result of the input’s conditions.
Rule 5. The smart contract’s input must include every parameter considered in the logical statements.
Rule 6. You can create structs to encapsulate necessary parameters to produce cleaner code.

Respond with “I am ready” if you understand, and repeat your given task and the rules before we start.
