This Solidity smart contract encapsulates the logic from the insurance policy document, its summary, and the CQL named expressions. It uses two structs to represent patient characteristics and the final coverage decision. The contract provides functions to determine eligibility for drug coverage and home health nurse or aide coverage, as well as a function to make the final coverage decision based on the patient's characteristics. The contract assumes that the input data (patient characteristics) is provided correctly and does not include any access control or state management, as it is a simplified representation of the policy logic.
