This CQL library defines named expressions that represent the requirements for coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs as described in the insurance policy document and its summary. The `FinalCoverageDecision` expression combines all the necessary conditions to determine if a patient is eligible for coverage under the policy. Please note that some expressions, such as `QualifiesForMedicareHomeHealthBenefit` and `UnableToSelfAdminister`, would need to be further defined based on the specific criteria set forth by Medicare and the patient's doctor's certification, respectively.
