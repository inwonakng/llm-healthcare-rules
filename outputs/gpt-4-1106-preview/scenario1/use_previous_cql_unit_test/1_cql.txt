This CQL library defines the necessary conditions for coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs under Medicare as described in the insurance policy document and its summary. The `CoverageDecision` named expression combines all the criteria to determine if the patient is eligible for either the drug coverage or the home health nurse/aide service to administer the drug.
