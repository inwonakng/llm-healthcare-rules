Based on the provided summary, CQL named expressions, and Solidity unit tests, here is a Solidity smart contract that implements the insurance policy for injectable osteoporosis drugs coverage:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareCoverageContract {
    // Define a struct to encapsulate patient information for cleaner code
    struct PatientInfo {
        bool isWoman;
        bool hasOsteoporosis;
        bool qualifiesForHomeHealthBenefit;
        bool hasCertifiedFracture;
        bool canSelfAdminister;
        bool hasAideAvailable;
    }

    // Define a function to check if the patient is covered
    function isCovered(
        bool isWoman,
        bool hasOsteoporosis,
        bool qualifiesForHomeHealthBenefit,
        bool hasCertifiedFracture,
        bool canSelfAdminister,
        bool hasAideAvailable
    ) public pure returns (bool) {
        // Check if all conditions for injectable osteoporosis drug coverage are met
        bool injectableOsteoporosisDrugCoverageCriteriaMet = (
            isWoman &&
            hasOsteoporosis &&
            qualifiesForHomeHealthBenefit &&
            hasCertifiedFracture &&
            !canSelfAdminister
        );

        // Check if conditions for home health aide coverage are met
        bool homeHealthAideCoverageCriteriaMet = (
            injectableOsteoporosisDrugCoverageCriteriaMet &&
            !hasAideAvailable
        );

        // Determine if the patient is eligible for coverage
        bool isEligibleForCoverage = (
            injectableOsteoporosisDrugCoverageCriteriaMet ||
            homeHealthAideCoverageCriteriaMet
        );

        return isEligibleForCoverage;
    }
}
```

This contract defines a `PatientInfo` struct to encapsulate the patient's information and a function `isCovered` that checks if a patient is covered based on the conditions provided in the summary. The function returns `true` if the patient is eligible for coverage and `false` otherwise.

Please note that the actual implementation of the CQL expressions such as `QualifiesForMedicareHomeHealthBenefit`, `DoctorCertifiedFractureRelatedToOsteoporosis`, `UnableToSelfAdminister`, and `FamilyOrCaregiversUnableToAdminister` would require additional information and are not fully implemented in this contract. These expressions are represented by boolean parameters in the `isCovered` function, and it is assumed that the evaluation of these conditions would be done off-chain before calling the smart contract function.
