This CQL library defines the necessary conditions for coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs under Medicare as described in the insurance policy document and its summary. The `CoverageDecision` named expression will yield `true` if the patient meets the criteria for either the drug coverage itself or the coverage of a home health nurse or aide to administer the drug.
