Please note that the actual CQL expressions for `QualifiesForMedicareHomeHealthBenefit`, `UnableToSelfAdministerInjection`, and `FamilyOrCaregiversUnableToAdminister` would need to be defined based on the specific criteria set forth by Medicare, which may involve more detailed clinical or administrative data. The codes used in the `code in` clauses would also need to be replaced with the actual codes from a terminology such as SNOMED CT or ICD-10 that represent the conditions and characteristics mentioned.
