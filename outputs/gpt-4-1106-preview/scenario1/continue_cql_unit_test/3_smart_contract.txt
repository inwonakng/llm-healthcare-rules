This Solidity smart contract provides two functions, `isCovered` and `isCoveredWithFamily`, which implement the insurance policy document's requirements. The `isCovered` function checks if a patient meets the criteria for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs. The `isCoveredWithFamily` function checks if the patient is also covered for the services of a home health nurse or aide to administer the injection, considering the family's ability to administer the drug.

The contract uses a `PatientInfo` struct for potential future expansion or if the contract needs to store patient information on the blockchain. However, the current implementation of the functions does not require storing any patient data on-chain, as they are `pure` functions that only perform calculations based on the input parameters.
