This CQL library defines the necessary conditions for a female Medicare patient to be eligible for coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs. Each named expression corresponds to a specific requirement from the insurance policy document. The final decision on eligibility is determined by the `InjectableOsteoporosisDrugCoverageEligibility` expression, which combines all the individual conditions. Please note that some expressions assume the existence of certain data or functions (e.g., `MeetsHomeHealthBenefitCriteria`, `DoctorCertifiedFractureRelatedToOsteoporosis`, `CannotSelfAdminister`, `FamilyOrCaregiversUnable`) that would need to be defined based on the actual data model and business rules of the healthcare system.
