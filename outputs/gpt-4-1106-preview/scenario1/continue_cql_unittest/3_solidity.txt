This Solidity smart contract implements the logic based on the insurance policy document, its summary, and the CQL named expressions. The `PatientInfo` struct encapsulates the necessary parameters to determine coverage. The `isCovered` function takes a `PatientInfo` struct as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the patient is covered based on the criteria discussed earlier. The contract assumes that all the necessary checks (such as the doctor's certification) are represented by the boolean fields in the `PatientInfo` struct.
