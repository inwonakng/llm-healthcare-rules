Based on the provided summary, N3 logic rules, and Solidity unit tests, here is an example of how the `MedicareContract` smart contract could be implemented in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareContract {
    // Define a struct to encapsulate the insured's information for cleaner code
    struct InsuredInfo {
        bool isWoman;
        bool diagnosedWithOsteoporosis;
        bool meetsHomeHealthCriteria;
        bool hasCertifiedFracture;
        bool unableToSelfAdminister;
        bool familyUnableToAdminister;
        bool familyUnwillingToAdminister;
    }

    // Function to check if the insured is covered for injectable osteoporosis drugs
    function isCovered(
        bool isWoman,
        bool diagnosedWithOsteoporosis,
        bool meetsHomeHealthCriteria,
        bool hasCertifiedFracture,
        bool unableToSelfAdminister
    ) public pure returns (bool) {
        return isWoman &&
               diagnosedWithOsteoporosis &&
               meetsHomeHealthCriteria &&
               hasCertifiedFracture &&
               unableToSelfAdminister;
    }

    // Function to check if the insured is covered for a home health nurse or aide
    function isCoveredForNurse(
        bool familyUnableToAdminister,
        bool familyUnwillingToAdminister
    ) public pure returns (bool) {
        return familyUnableToAdminister || familyUnwillingToAdminister;
    }
}
```

This contract implements the logic described in the summary and N3 rules. The `isCovered` function checks if the insured is a woman diagnosed with osteoporosis, meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit, has a bone fracture certified by a doctor as related to post-menopausal osteoporosis, and is unable to self-administer the injection or learn to do so. The `isCoveredForNurse` function checks if the insured's family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug by injection.

The unit tests provided would interact with this contract to ensure that the conditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected for various scenarios.
