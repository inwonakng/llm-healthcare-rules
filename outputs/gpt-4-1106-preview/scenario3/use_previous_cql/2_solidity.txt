This Solidity smart contract represents a simplified version of the insurance policy document and CQL named expressions. It includes functions to check various conditions and eligibility criteria, update coverage and payment information, and enroll in benefits. The contract assumes that the ether unit is used as a placeholder for a stablecoin to represent monetary values. In a real-world scenario, integration with a stablecoin contract or payment gateway would be necessary to handle actual monetary transactions. Additionally, the contract does not include access control mechanisms, which would be essential to ensure that only authorized entities can update coverage and payment information.
