Please note that the above CQL expressions are based on the provided policy document and summary. The actual implementation would require access to the complete set of codes for organ transplant procedures, End-Stage Renal Disease, and insurance types, as well as the Medicare-approved amount for immunosuppressive drugs. The expressions also assume the existence of certain FHIR extensions and coding systems that would need to be defined in a real-world scenario.
