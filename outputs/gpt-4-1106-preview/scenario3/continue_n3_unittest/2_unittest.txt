Certainly! Below is a set of Solidity unit tests based on the insurance policy document, its summary, and the N3 logic rules. These tests are designed for a hypothetical `MedicareSupplementContract` and use the Solidity testing framework provided by Truffle, which typically involves the `Assert` library for assertions.

Please note that these tests are illustrative and assume the existence of certain functions within the `MedicareSupplementContract` that would check eligibility, calculate premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance rates. The actual implementation of these functions is not provided here, as the task is to only implement the unit tests.

These tests assume that the contract functions return the correct values based on the input parameters. The actual contract would need to implement the logic to check eligibility, calculate premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance rates according to the rules provided in the insurance policy document and its summary. The tests also assume that monetary values are represented in the smallest unit (e.g., cents) to avoid floating-point numbers in Solidity.
