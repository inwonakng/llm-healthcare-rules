This CQL library defines expressions based on the requirements from the insurance policy document and its summary. Each named expression corresponds to a specific requirement or condition that must be met for coverage or benefits to apply. The expressions use hypothetical FHIR extensions to represent Medicare parts and other coverage details, which would need to be adjusted to match the actual FHIR implementation.
