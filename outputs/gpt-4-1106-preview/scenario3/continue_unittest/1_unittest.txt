Certainly! Below are some Solidity unit tests that correspond to the insurance policy document and its summary. These tests are written for a hypothetical `TransplantDrugCoverage` contract that would manage the insurance policy logic. The tests use the Solidity testing framework provided by tools like Truffle or Hardhat, which typically use Chai for assertions.

    // Test 12 & 13: Monthly premium and deductible for immunosuppressive drug benefit.
    function testImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefitCosts() public {
        uint premium = 9710; // Represented in cents to avoid decimals
        uint deductible = 22600; // Represented in cents to avoid decimals

        Assert.equal(calculatedPremium, premium, "Monthly premium should be $97.10.");
        Assert.equal(calculatedDeductible, deductible, "Deductible should be $226.");
    }

    // Additional tests would be needed to cover all aspects of the policy, including the 20% payment after deductible,
    // and the ability to sign up for the benefit via a call (which would be simulated in a smart contract context).
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `TransplantDrugCoverage` contract would need to handle the logic for checking eligibility, coverage, and costs. The unit tests above assume that such functions (`checkTransplantDrugCoverage`, `checkPartAEligibility`, `checkPartBEligibility`, `checkPartDCoverage`, `checkESRDCoverageEnd`, `checkImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefitEligibility`, `getImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefitCosts`) exist and return the expected boolean or uint values.

Also, the actual contract would need to handle timestamps and durations more carefully, potentially using a time library or block timestamps, and would need to manage state related to individual enrollees, their coverage status, and payments.
