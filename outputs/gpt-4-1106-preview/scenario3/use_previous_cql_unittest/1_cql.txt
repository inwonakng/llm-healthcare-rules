Please note that the above CQL expressions are based on the provided document and summary. The actual implementation would require access to the specific code systems and value sets (e.g., "Organ Transplant Procedure Codes", "Immunosuppressive Drug Codes") that define the medical procedures and medications referenced in the policy. Additionally, the logic assumes the existence of certain patient attributes and functions (e.g., `partAActiveDuring`, `partBActiveDuring`, `hasESRD`, `medicareApprovedAmountFor`) that would need to be defined in the context of the healthcare data model being used.
