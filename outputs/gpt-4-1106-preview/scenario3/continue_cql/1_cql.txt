Please note that the actual implementation would require the definition of the value sets for "Organ Transplant Procedure Codes", "Immunosuppressive Drug Codes", and the coverage types such as 'PartD', 'MedicareDrugPlan', 'GroupHealthPlan', 'TRICARE', 'Medicaid', and 'ImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefit'. Additionally, the URLs for the Medicare Part A and Part B extensions would need to be defined according to the FHIR profiles used by the healthcare organization.
