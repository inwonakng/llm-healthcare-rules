Please note that the actual implementation of the `MedicareContract` is not provided here, as the task was to only implement the unit tests. The tests assume that the contract has functions like `checkTransplantDrugCoverage`, `checkPartDCoverage`, `checkCoverageAfterTransplant`, `checkBenefitEligibility`, `getMonthlyPremium`, `getAnnualDeductible`, and `getCostAfterDeductible` which correspond to the policy rules. The tests also assume that monetary values are handled in cents to avoid floating-point issues in Solidity.
