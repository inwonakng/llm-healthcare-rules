Based on the provided summary and unit tests, here is a possible implementation of the `MedicareContract` in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareContract {
    uint256 public constant MONTHLY_PREMIUM_CENTS = 9710; // $97.10
    uint256 public constant ANNUAL_DEDUCTIBLE_CENTS = 22600; // $226.00
    uint256 public constant COVERAGE_END_MONTHS_AFTER_TRANSPLANT = 36;

    struct PolicyHolder {
        bool hasPartA;
        bool hasPartB;
        bool hasPartD;
        bool hasESRD;
        uint256 transplantDate;
        uint256 partAEndDate;
        bool hasOtherCoverage;
    }

    mapping(address => PolicyHolder) public policyHolders;

    function checkTransplantDrugCoverage(bool hasPartA, bool hasPartB, bool medicareContributed) public pure returns (bool) {
        return medicareContributed && hasPartA && hasPartB;
    }

    function checkPartDCoverage(bool hasPartD, bool hasPartB) public pure returns (bool) {
        return hasPartD && !hasPartB;
    }

    function checkCoverageAfterTransplant(uint256 transplantDate, bool hasESRD) public view returns (bool) {
        return hasESRD && (block.timestamp - transplantDate) < (COVERAGE_END_MONTHS_AFTER_TRANSPLANT * 30 days);
    }

    function checkBenefitEligibility(uint256 partAEndDate, bool hasOtherCoverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return (block.timestamp > partAEndDate) && !hasOtherCoverage;
    }

    function getMonthlyPremium() public pure returns (uint256) {
        return MONTHLY_PREMIUM_CENTS;
    }

    function getAnnualDeductible() public pure returns (uint256) {
        return ANNUAL_DEDUCTIBLE_CENTS;
    }

    function getCostAfterDeductible(uint256 deductible, uint256 medicareApprovedAmount) public pure returns (uint256) {
        if (deductible >= ANNUAL_DEDUCTIBLE_CENTS) {
            return (medicareApprovedAmount * 20) / 100; // 20% of the approved amount
        } else {
            return 0; // Deductible not met
        }
    }

    // Additional functions to manage policy holders could be added here
    // For example, enrolling a policy holder, updating their coverage, etc.
}
```

This contract implements the basic logic described in the summary and is designed to pass the unit tests provided. It uses a `PolicyHolder` struct to encapsulate the necessary parameters for each policyholder and a mapping to store the data. The functions are made `pure` or `view` where possible since they do not modify the state.

Please note that this is a simplified example and a real-world contract would need to handle more complex logic, security considerations, and possibly interact with other contracts or off-chain data sources. Additionally, the contract assumes that the time unit for `transplantDate` and `partAEndDate` is a Unix timestamp, and it uses `30 days` as an approximation for a month, which may not be accurate for all months.
