Certainly! Below is a set of Solidity unit tests that correspond to the insurance policy document, its summary, and the N3 logic rules we discussed. These tests are written for Solidity version 0.8.0 and use the `remix_tests.sol` library for the test syntax.

        uint256 owedAmount = insurancePolicyContract.calculateOwedAmount(true, approvedAmount);
        uint256 expectedOwedAmount = approvedAmount * 20 / 100; // 20% of approved amount

}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `InsurancePolicyContract` and its functions such as `checkTransplantDrugTherapyEligibility`, `checkCanJoinMedicareDrugPlan`, `checkImmunosuppressiveDrugsCoverage`, `checkMedicareCoverageEnds`, `checkEligibilityForImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefit`, `checkCanSignUpForBenefit`, `getImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefitCosts`, and `calculateOwedAmount` are not provided here. These functions should be implemented in the contract to match the logic of the insurance policy document and its summary.

The tests assume that the contract functions return the expected boolean values or costs based on the policy rules. The `Assert.equal` function is used to compare the expected and actual results, and the tests will pass if the contract functions behave as per the policy rules.
