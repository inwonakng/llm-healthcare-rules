Certainly! Below is a Solidity smart contract that implements the logic based on the insurance policy document, its summary, and the N3 logic rules. This contract includes functions that correspond to the conditions and rules we've discussed. It's designed to determine eligibility for Medicare's immunosuppressive drug benefit and calculate associated costs like premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance rates.

This contract provides a simplified representation of the logic required to determine eligibility and calculate costs for the Medicare immunosuppressive drug benefit. It assumes that all necessary information is provided as input to the functions. The `getCosts` function is hardcoded for the year 2023, but in a real-world scenario, you would likely have a more dynamic way of handling different years and cost data.

Please note that this contract does not handle state changes or store any data on the blockchain. It's purely functional and stateless, designed to be called with the necessary parameters to determine eligibility and costs. In a production environment, you would need to consider additional factors such as access control, data validation, error handling, and state management.
