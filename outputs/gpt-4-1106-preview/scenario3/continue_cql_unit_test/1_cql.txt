Please note that the above CQL expressions are hypothetical and based on the provided summary. In a real-world scenario, the expressions would need to be validated for accuracy and completeness against the actual data model and business rules of the Medicare system. Additionally, the expressions assume the existence of certain functions (like `CalculateDurationSinceTransplant`) and patient attributes that would need to be defined in a real implementation.
