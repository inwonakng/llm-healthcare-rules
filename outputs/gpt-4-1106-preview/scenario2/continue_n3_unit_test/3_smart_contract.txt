Certainly! Below is a Solidity smart contract that implements the insurance policy document, its summary, and the N3 logic rules we discussed. This contract is designed to work with Solidity version 0.8.0.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IVIGCoverageContract {
    // Define a struct to encapsulate patient information
    struct Patient {
        bool hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease;
        bool hasDoctorApproval;
        bool receivesIVIGAtHome;
    }

    // Function to check if the patient is eligible for IVIG coverage
    function checkCoverage(
        bool hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease,
        bool hasDoctorApproval,
        bool receivesIVIGAtHome
    ) public pure returns (bool) {
        // Check all conditions for eligibility
        return hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease && hasDoctorApproval && receivesIVIGAtHome;
    }

    // Function to check if the patient is covered for related services
    function checkRelatedServicesCoverage(
        bool receivesIVIGAtHome
    ) public pure returns (bool) {
        // Patients are not covered for related services when receiving IVIG at home
        return !receivesIVIGAtHome;
    }
}
```

This contract provides two functions:

1. `checkCoverage`: This function takes three boolean arguments representing whether the patient has a primary immune deficiency disease, has doctor approval, and receives IVIG at home. It returns `true` if all conditions are met, indicating that the patient is eligible for IVIG coverage under Medicare Part B.

2. `checkRelatedServicesCoverage`: This function takes a boolean argument representing whether the patient receives IVIG at home. It returns `false` because, according to the policy, Medicare Part B does not cover related services when IVIG is administered at home.

Please note that this contract is a simplified representation and does not handle patient records or actual insurance claims. In a real-world application, additional functionality would be required to manage patient data securely and to integrate with healthcare providers and insurance systems.
