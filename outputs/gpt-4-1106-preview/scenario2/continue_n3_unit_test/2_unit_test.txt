Certainly! Below is a set of Solidity unit tests that correspond to the insurance policy document, its summary, and the N3 logic rules we discussed. These tests are written for a hypothetical smart contract that would handle the logic of Medicare Part B coverage for IVIG provided at home.

    function testIneligiblePatientNoDoctorApproval() public {

        bool result = coverageContract.isEligibleForCoverage(patient);
        Assert.equal(result, false, "Patient without doctor's approval should not be eligible for coverage");
    }

    // Test for a patient who does not receive IVIG at home
    function testIneligiblePatientNotReceivingIVIGAtHome() public {
        Patient memory patient = Patient(true, true, false);
        bool result = coverageContract.isEligibleForCoverage(patient);
        Assert.equal(result, false, "Patient not receiving IVIG at home should not be eligible for coverage");
    }
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the `isEligibleForCoverage` function in the `MedicarePartBIVIGCoverage` contract is not provided here, as the task was to only implement the unit tests. The tests assume that the contract's function correctly implements the logic based on the patient's information. The `Assert.equal` function is used to check if the result from the contract matches the expected outcome.
