Certainly! Below is a set of Solidity unit tests that correspond to the insurance policy document, its summary, and the N3 logic rules we discussed. These tests are written for Solidity version 0.8.0 and use the `remix_tests.sol` library for the test syntax.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `IVIGCoverageContract` and its functions `checkCoverage` and `checkRelatedServicesCoverage` are not provided here, as the task was to only implement the unit tests. The contract would need to be implemented to handle the logic for checking coverage based on the patient's information. The tests assume that the contract has functions to check coverage for IVIG and related services, which return a boolean indicating whether the patient is covered or not.
