Please note that the above code assumes the existence of a contract named `IVIGCoverage` which has a function `checkCoverage` that returns a tuple with three booleans indicating whether IVIG is covered, whether the medication is covered, and whether the related services are covered. The `MockPatient` contract is used to simulate the patient's conditions and doctor's decisions. The actual implementation of the `IVIGCoverage` contract would need to be developed to pass these tests.
