Please note that the actual implementation of the `IVIGInsuranceContract` is not provided here, as the task was to only implement the unit tests. The contract would need to have functions like `isCovered`, `isIVIGCoveredUnderPartB`, and `areRelatedServicesCovered` that take the appropriate parameters and return booleans indicating coverage. The tests assume these functions exist and are public in the contract.
