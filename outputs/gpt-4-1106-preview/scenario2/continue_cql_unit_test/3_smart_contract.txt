This Solidity smart contract implements the logic required to determine the eligibility of IVIG coverage based on the insurance policy document, its summary, and the CQL named expressions. The `checkEligibility` function takes four boolean parameters that represent the conditions outlined in the policy and returns a boolean indicating whether the patient is eligible for coverage. The contract assumes that the input parameters are provided correctly according to the policy requirements.
