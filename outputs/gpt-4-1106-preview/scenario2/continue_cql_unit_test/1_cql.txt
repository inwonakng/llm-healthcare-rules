This CQL library defines named expressions that represent the requirements from the insurance policy document. The final decision on whether IVIG is covered is represented by the `IVIGCoverageEligibility` expression, which combines all the individual requirements. Please note that the actual code sets for conditions, procedures, medications, and non-covered items would need to be defined based on the insurance policy's coding system (e.g., ICD-10, HCPCS, etc.).
