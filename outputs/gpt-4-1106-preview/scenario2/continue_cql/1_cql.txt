This CQL library defines named expressions that represent the requirements from the insurance policy document. The `IVIGCoverageEligibility` expression combines these requirements to determine if a patient is eligible for IVIG coverage under Medicare when administered at home. The actual codes for primary immune deficiency diseases, appropriate home IVIG procedure requests, IVIG medications, and non-covered items and services would need to be defined according to the specific coding system used (e.g., ICD-10, HCPCS) and included in the respective value sets referenced in the CQL.
