Based on the provided summary, N3 logic rules, and Solidity unit tests, here is a Solidity smart contract that implements the insurance policy for IVIG coverage:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IVIGCoverageContract {
    // Define a struct to encapsulate the parameters for cleaner code
    struct IVIGCoverageParams {
        bool providedInHome;
        bool hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency;
        bool medicallyAppropriate;
    }

    // Function to determine if IVIG is covered
    function isIVIGCovered(IVIGCoverageParams memory params) public pure returns (bool coverage, bool partBCoversIVIG, bool partBDoesNotCoverRelatedServices) {
        // Check if all conditions for coverage are met
        bool isEligibleForCoverage = params.providedInHome && params.hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency && params.medicallyAppropriate;

        // Medicare Part B covers the cost of IVIG if eligible
        partBCoversIVIG = isEligibleForCoverage;

        // Medicare Part B does not cover the cost of other items and services related to the administration of IVIG at home
        partBDoesNotCoverRelatedServices = isEligibleForCoverage;

        // Return the coverage status along with details about what Medicare Part B covers
        return (isEligibleForCoverage, partBCoversIVIG, partBDoesNotCoverRelatedServices);
    }
}
```

This contract includes a function `isIVIGCovered` that takes a `IVIGCoverageParams` struct as input and returns three boolean values indicating whether IVIG is covered, whether Medicare Part B covers the cost of IVIG, and whether Medicare Part B does not cover the cost of other items and services related to the administration of IVIG at home.

The contract assumes that the input parameters are provided correctly and does not include any access control or state management, as these aspects were not specified in the summary or the N3 logic rules. The function is marked as `pure` because it does not read from or modify the state of the contract.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as access control, event logging, error handling, and integration with external systems (e.g., for verifying diagnoses or medical appropriateness) would likely be necessary.
