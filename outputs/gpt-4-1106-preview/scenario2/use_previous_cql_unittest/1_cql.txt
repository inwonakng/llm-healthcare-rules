This CQL library defines the conditions under which Medicare covers IVIG provided in the patient's home. It includes named expressions for each requirement described in the insurance policy document and its summary. The final decision on coverage eligibility is determined by the `IVIGCoverageEligibility` expression, which combines all the individual requirements.
