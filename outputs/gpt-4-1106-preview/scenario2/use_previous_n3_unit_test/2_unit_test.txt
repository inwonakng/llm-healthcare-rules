Please note that the actual implementation of the `IVIGCoverageContract` is not provided here, as the task was to write only the unit tests. The tests assume the existence of certain functions within the contract that would be called to check eligibility and coverage. The mock data and placeholder return values are used to simulate the behavior of the contract during testing.
