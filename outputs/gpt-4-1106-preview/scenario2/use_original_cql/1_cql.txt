Please note that the actual ICD-10-CM code for primary immune deficiency disease should be used in place of 'D80.0', which is provided here as an example. The CQL assumes that the "IVIG Administration" code set is defined elsewhere in the FHIR terminology service being used. The `location` attribute in the `IVIGMedicallyAppropriateForHome` definition is a simplification and may need to be more specifically defined based on the actual FHIR resource attributes available.
