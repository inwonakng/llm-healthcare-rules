Please note that the actual codes for the code systems (e.g., "IVIGHomeAdministrationCodeSet", "PrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDiseaseCodeSet", "MedicalAppropriatenessCodeSet", "MedicarePartBPayorCodeSet", "ExcludedItemsAndServicesCodeSet") would need to be defined based on the specific coding system used by the healthcare provider or insurer. These are placeholders to illustrate how the CQL library would reference the necessary codes.
