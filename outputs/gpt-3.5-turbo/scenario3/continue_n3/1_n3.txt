# Policy Document
policy: a policy:Document ;
    rdfs:comment "Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant, and you must have Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs. Keep in mind, Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B doesn’t cover them. If you have Original Medicare, you may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage. If you only have Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant. Medicare offers a benefit that may help you, if you lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant, and you don’t have certain types of other health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs). This benefit only covers your immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services. It isn’t a substitute for full health coverage. If you qualify, you can sign up for this benefit any time after your Part A coverage ends. To sign up, call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788." .
