Summary: 
Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if they helped pay for the organ transplant, and there are specific requirements for coverage. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B does not cover them. If someone has Original Medicare, they can join a Medicare drug plan for drug coverage. Coverage for Medicare, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant for individuals with Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Medicare offers a limited immunosuppressive drug coverage benefit for individuals who lose Part A coverage after 36 months and do not have certain other health coverage. This limited benefit only covers immunosuppressive drugs, not other items or services. In 2023, the monthly premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit is $97.10* with a $226 deductible, followed by a 20% payment of the Medicare-approved amount once the deductible is met.
