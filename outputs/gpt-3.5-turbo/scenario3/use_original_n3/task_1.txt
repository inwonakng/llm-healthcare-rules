High-level summary: 

Medicare provides coverage for transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant. However, there are certain requirements and conditions that need to be met.

Requirements for Medicare coverage:
1. Medicare must have helped pay for your organ transplant.
2. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant.
3. You must have Part B at the time you receive immunosuppressive drugs.

Additional considerations:
4. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B does not cover them.
5. If you have Original Medicare, you can join a Medicare drug plan for drug coverage.
6. If you only have Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.

Special benefit for lost coverage:
7. If you lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant and do not have certain types of other health coverage, Medicare offers a benefit that covers only immunosuppressive drugs.
8. This benefit is not a substitute for full health coverage.

Premium and payment:
9. In 2023, the monthly premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit is $97.10.
10. There is a $226 deductible.
11. After meeting the deductible, you will pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.
