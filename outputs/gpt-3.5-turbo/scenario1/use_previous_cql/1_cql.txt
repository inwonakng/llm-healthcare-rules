In the above CQL library, I have defined three named expressions based on the conditions mentioned in the insurance policy document and its summary:

1. `InjectableOsteoporosisDrugsCoverage`: This named expression checks if all the conditions for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs are met. It verifies if the patient has a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis, is a female, and the medication administered is an injectable osteoporosis drug. It also checks if the medication is administered by a nurse or aide.

2. `UnableToSelfAdminister`: This named expression checks if the patient is unable to self-administer the injectable osteoporosis drug. It verifies the same conditions as `InjectableOsteoporosisDrugsCoverage` and additionally checks if there is no procedure code indicating self-administration.

3. `FamilyOrCaregiversUnableOrUnwilling`: This named expression checks if the patient's family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the injectable osteoporosis drug. It verifies the same conditions as `InjectableOsteoporosisDrugsCoverage` and additionally checks if there is a procedure code indicating family or caregivers unable or unwilling to administer the drug.

These named expressions cover all the requirements mentioned in the insurance policy document and its summary.
