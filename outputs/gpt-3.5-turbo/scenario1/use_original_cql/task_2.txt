This CQL library extracts the named expressions from the natural language text and groups them together in a CQL library called "OsteoporosisDrugsCoverage". 

The library includes the following named expressions:

1. "diagnosis" makes sure the patient has a diagnosis of osteoporosis and is a female.
2. "homeHealth" checks if the patient meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
3. "fracture" verifies if the patient has a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
4. "age" ensures that the patient is at least 18 years old.
5. "exam" confirms that the patient cannot self-administer the drug by injection.
6. "givenMedication" checks if a home health nurse or aide can provide the injection.

The final decision named expression, "OsteoporosisDrugsCoverage decision," includes all the named expressions and returns the statement "Medicare covers injectable osteoporosis drugs" if all the conditions are met.
