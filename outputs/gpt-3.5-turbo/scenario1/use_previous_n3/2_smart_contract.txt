Here is a Solidity smart contract that implements the logic rules described in the N3 representation of the insurance policy document:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InjectableOsteoporosisDrugsCoverage {
    struct Policy {
        string label;
        Coverage coverage;
    }
    
    struct Coverage {
        string label;
        Condition[] conditions;
    }
    
    struct Condition {
        string label;
        Certification certification;
    }
    
    struct Certification {
        string label;
    }
    
    Policy public policy;
    
    constructor() {
        policy.label = "Injectable Osteoporosis Drugs Coverage";
        policy.coverage.label = "Injectable Osteoporosis Drugs";
        
        policy.coverage.conditions.push(Condition({
            label: "Condition 1",
            certification: Certification({
                label: "Medicare Home Health Benefit"
            })
        }));
        
        policy.coverage.conditions.push(Condition({
            label: "Condition 2",
            certification: Certification({
                label: "Bone Fracture Related to Osteoporosis"
            })
        }));
        
        policy.coverage.conditions.push(Condition({
            label: "Condition 3",
            certification: Certification({
                label: "Inability to Self-Administer Injection"
            })
        }));
        
        policy.coverage.conditions.push(Condition({
            label: "Condition 4",
            certification: Certification({
                label: "Inability or Unwillingness to Self-Administer Injection"
            })
        }));
    }
    
    function checkCoverage(bool meetsCriteria, bool hasCertifiedFracture, bool hasCertifiedInability, bool hasInabilityOrUnwillingness) public view returns (bool) {
        if (meetsCriteria && hasCertifiedFracture && hasCertifiedInability) {
            if (hasInabilityOrUnwillingness) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

The smart contract defines the necessary structs to represent the policy, coverage, conditions, and certifications. The constructor initializes the policy and its coverage with the corresponding labels and conditions.

The `checkCoverage` function takes four boolean parameters representing whether the individual meets the criteria, has a certified fracture, has a certified inability, and has an inability or unwillingness to self-administer the injection. It checks if all the conditions are met and returns `true` if coverage is provided, and `false` otherwise.

Note that the smart contract does not include the logic for actually providing the coverage or interacting with Medicare. It only implements the logic rules described in the insurance policy document.
