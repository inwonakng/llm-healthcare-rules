### N3 logic rules:

For a person to be covered for injectable osteoporosis drugs by Medicare:
- They must be a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
- They must have a bone fracture that a doctor certifies was related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
- Their doctor must certify that they cannot give themselves the injection or learn how to give the drug by injection.

In addition, if the person's family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to give them the drug by injection, Medicare will cover the home health nurse or aide to provide the injection.
