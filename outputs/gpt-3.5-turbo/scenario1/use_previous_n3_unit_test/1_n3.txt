The above N3 logic rules represent the insurance policy document and its summary for Injectable Osteoporosis Drugs coverage. The policy requires three conditions to be met: 
1. The individual must meet the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
2. The individual must have a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis, certified by a doctor.
3. The individual must be unable to self-administer the injection or learn how to do so, certified by a doctor.

If the family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the injection, Medicare will cover the home health nurse or aide to provide the injection. This is represented by the additional condition 4: the individual must have an inability or unwillingness to self-administer the injection.

Each condition and certification is represented as a separate resource with a label, and the relationships between the policy, conditions, certifications, and coverage are defined using RDF properties.
