The smart contract `InsurancePolicy` implements the conditions and decisions described in the summary and N3 logic rules.

The `Patient` struct represents the insurance policy details for each patient. It includes boolean variables to track the conditions and decisions.

The `patients` mapping is used to store the insurance policy details for each patient.

The `setPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease` function allows setting the condition of having primary immune deficiency disease for a patient.

The `setMedicallyAppropriate` function allows setting the condition of being medically appropriate for a patient.

The `checkCoverIVIG` function checks if a patient is eligible for IVIG coverage based on the conditions. It updates the `coverIVIG` variable accordingly.

The `checkCoverIVIGInHome` function checks if a patient is eligible for IVIG coverage in home based on the conditions. It updates the `coverIVIGInHome` variable accordingly.

The `checkCoverIVIGCost` function checks if a patient is eligible for IVIG cost coverage based on the conditions. It updates the `coverIVIGCost` variable accordingly.

The `checkDoNotCoverOtherServices` function checks if a patient is eligible for not covering other services based on the conditions. It updates the `doNotCoverOtherServices` variable accordingly.

These functions can be called externally to set the conditions and decisions for a patient and retrieve the insurance policy details for a patient.
