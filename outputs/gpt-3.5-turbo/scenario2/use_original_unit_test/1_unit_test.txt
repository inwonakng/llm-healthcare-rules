In the above code, we have implemented three tests for the insurance policy related to Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) coverage.

1. `testIVIGCoverage`: This test checks if IVIG is covered by Medicare when the patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease and the doctor determines that it's medically appropriate to receive IVIG at home.

2. `testIVIGCoverage_NotCovered`: This test checks if IVIG is not covered by Medicare when the patient has a diagnosis other than primary immune deficiency disease, but the doctor determines that it's medically appropriate to receive IVIG at home.

3. `testIVIGCoverage_NotMedicallyAppropriate`: This test checks if IVIG is not covered by Medicare when the patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, but the doctor determines that it's not medically appropriate to receive IVIG at home.
