Sure! Here's a Solidity smart contract that covers the given natural language text:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IVIGCoverage {
    struct Patient {
        bool hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency;
        bool isMedicallyAppropriate;
        bool isCovered;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Patient) public patients;
    
    function requestIVIGCoverage(bool hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency, bool isMedicallyAppropriate) external {
        patients[msg.sender] = Patient(hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency, isMedicallyAppropriate, false);
    }
    
    function checkIVIGCoverage() external view returns (bool) {
        Patient memory patient = patients[msg.sender];
        
        if (patient.hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency && patient.isMedicallyAppropriate) {
            return patient.isCovered;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    function approveIVIGCoverage(address patientAddress) external {
        patients[patientAddress].isCovered = true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The smart contract defines a struct called `Patient` that encapsulates the parameters required for IVIG coverage: `hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency`, `isMedicallyAppropriate`, and `isCovered`.
- The contract uses a mapping `patients` to associate each patient's address with their respective `Patient` struct.
- The `requestIVIGCoverage` function allows a patient to request IVIG coverage by providing the necessary parameters: `hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency` and `isMedicallyAppropriate`.
- The `checkIVIGCoverage` function allows a patient to check if they are covered for IVIG based on their diagnosis and medical appropriateness.
- The `approveIVIGCoverage` function can be called by a doctor or authorized entity to approve IVIG coverage for a specific patient.

Note: This smart contract provides a basic implementation to cover the conditions described in the given natural language text. Additional functionality or validation can be added as per the specific requirements of the use case.
