Here's a Solidity smart contract that implements the conditions described in the natural language text:

This smart contract allows beneficiaries to enroll by providing their coverage information and transplant date. It includes functions to calculate the monthly premium, deductible, and cost of drugs based on the coverage conditions. The `applyBenefit` function checks if a beneficiary is eligible for the special benefit based on the provided conditions. The contract also provides functions to check the eligibility status and coverage end date for a beneficiary.
