In this example, the `InsurancePolicy` contract is assumed to have two functions: `isCovered` and `getCoveredAmount`. The `isCovered` function takes the name of the treatment, a boolean indicating whether a doctor has approved the treatment, the location where the treatment is provided, and the diagnosis of the patient. It returns a boolean indicating whether the treatment is covered by the policy. The `getCoveredAmount` function takes the name of the treatment and the part of the policy, and returns the amount covered by the policy for that treatment under that part.
