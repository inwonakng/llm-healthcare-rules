This is a set of unit tests for the InsurancePolicy contract. The tests check if the insurance policy covers IVIG provided at home, if the insured has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, and if it is medically appropriate as per the doctor. The tests also check if the insurance policy under Part B covers the cost of IVIG itself and if the policy does not cover the cost of other items and services related to the insured receiving IVIG at home.
