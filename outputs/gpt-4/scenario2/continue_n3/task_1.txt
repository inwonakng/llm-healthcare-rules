Summary:

1. Medicare will cover Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) if a patient is diagnosed with primary immune deficiency disease.
2. The decision for home-based IVIG treatment is dependent on the evaluation of the patient's doctor regarding its medical appropriateness.
3. Medicare Part B will specifically cover the cost of the IVIG drug itself.
4. Medicare Part B, however, will not cover the cost related to other services and items involved in the home administration of IVIG.
