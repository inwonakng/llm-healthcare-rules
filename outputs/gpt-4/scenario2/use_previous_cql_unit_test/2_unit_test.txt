In the above tests, the `isCovered` function takes four parameters: the name of the treatment, a boolean indicating if the treatment is provided at home, the diagnosis of the patient, and a boolean indicating if the doctor has approved the treatment. The `isPartBCovered` function takes the name of the treatment as a parameter. The `isOtherItemsAndServicesCovered` function takes the name of the treatment and a boolean indicating if the treatment is provided at home as parameters.
