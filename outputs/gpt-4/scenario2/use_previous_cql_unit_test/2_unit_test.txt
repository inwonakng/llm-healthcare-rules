This is a set of unit tests for the InsurancePolicy contract. Each test corresponds to a condition described in the summary of the insurance policy document. The InsurancePolicy contract is not implemented here, but it is assumed that it has the methods isIVIGCovered, isCoveredWithDisease, isCoveredWithDoctorApproval, isCoveredUnderPartB, and isOtherItemsCovered. These methods are expected to return a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met.
