This Solidity smart contract encapsulates the rules specified. We use a mapping to associate address to Patient struct. Patients are identified by their Ethereum address and have attributes representing details in natural language text (hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency, isIVIGAppropriate). A function to set those details (`insertPatientDetails`) is provided. We have two view functions `isIVIGCovered`, `isOtherItemsCovered` that check patient's eligibility for IVIG coverage and other items services relating to IVIG at home respectively.
