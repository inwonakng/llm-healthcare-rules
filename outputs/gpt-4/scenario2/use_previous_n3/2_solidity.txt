In the above Solidity contract:

- A `Patient` struct is defined to hold the patient's information.
- A mapping `patients` is created to map an address to a `Patient`.
- The `setPatient` function is used to set the patient's information and determine their insurance coverage based on the conditions provided in the N3 rules.
- The `checkCoverage` function is used to check a patient's insurance coverage.
