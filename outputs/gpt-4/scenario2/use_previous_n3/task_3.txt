This Solidity code provides a way for coverage determination for IVIG treatment. The 'Patient' struct is used to store information about the patient: if they have been diagnosed with PIDD and if Home IVIG is doctor appropriated. The 'Service' struct stores the information about the coverage by Medicare and Medicare Part B for IVIG, Home IVIG and other services for Home IVIG.

The provided functions allow setting the diagnosed and doctor warranted status for patients, determine coverages based on conditions mentioned in text, and obtain the coverage details for a given patient.
