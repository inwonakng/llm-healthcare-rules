Please note that the actual implementation of the `InsurancePolicy` contract and the methods `checkPrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDiagnosis`, `checkDoctorApprovalForHomeIVIG`, `checkPartBCoverageForIVIG`, and `checkPartBCoverageForOtherItemsAndServices` are not provided here. These methods should be implemented in the `InsurancePolicy` contract to return the appropriate boolean values based on the patient's data.
