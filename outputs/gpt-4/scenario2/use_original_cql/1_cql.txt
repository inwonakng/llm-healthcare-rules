This CQL library defines several named expressions that represent the conditions described in the insurance policy document. The "Primary Immune Deficiency Disease" expression checks if the patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease. The "Medically Appropriate IVIG" expression checks if the patient has been prescribed IVIG and has a primary immune deficiency disease. The "IVIG in Home" expression checks if the IVIG is being administered at home. Finally, the "IVIG Coverage" expression checks if the patient's Medicare Part B covers the IVIG at home but does not cover other items and services related to the IVIG at home.
