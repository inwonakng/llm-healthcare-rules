This Solidity smart contract includes a `Patient` struct to represent each patient with a primary immune deficiency disease. The struct includes attributes such as `hasPrimaryImmuneDeficiency` and `doctorApprovalForHomeIVIG` to ensure that the conditions mentioned in the natural language text are covered and implemented.

A mapping `patients` is used to map each patient's address to their respective `Patient` struct.

The function `getIVIGCoverage` is used to determine what coverage a patient is eligible for based on their diagnosis and doctor's approval for home IVIG. The function returns a string indicating the patient's coverage.

Finally, the `addPatient` function is used to add a new patient to the `patients` mapping, requiring all the information needed to determine eligibility for coverage.
