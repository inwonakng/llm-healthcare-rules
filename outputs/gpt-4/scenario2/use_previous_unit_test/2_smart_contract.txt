This contract allows to set the insured's medical condition and check if the policy covers IVIG at home, if the insured has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, if it's medically appropriate for the insured to receive IVIG at home, if the coverage under Part B of the policy includes the cost of IVIG itself and if Part B of the policy does not cover the cost of other items and services related to the insured receiving IVIG at home.
