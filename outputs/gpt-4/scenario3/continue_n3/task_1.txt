1. Medicare will cover the cost of transplant drug therapy, provided that they contributed to the payment of your organ transplant.
2. For this coverage, it's essential that the individual has Medicare Part A during the time of the covered transplant, and Medicare Part B when receiving immunosuppressive drugs.
3. In case Medicare Part B does not cover the immunosuppressive drugs, Medicare drug coverage (Part D) will provide coverage.
4. If an individual has Original Medicare, they can join a Medicare drug plan for Medicare drug coverage.
5. If an individual only has Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), their Medicare and associated immunosuppressive drug coverage will conclude 36 months post a successful kidney transplant.
6. Medicare provides additional benefits. If an individual loses Part A coverage after 36 months from a kidney transplant and doesnâ€™t have certain other health coverage, Medicare can cover only the immunosuppressive drugs without any other items or services.
7. This benefit is not a replacement for full health coverage.
8. If the individual qualifies, they can apply for this benefit at any time after their Part A coverage is terminated by contacting Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can contact via 1-800-325-0788.
9. As per 2023 rates, the monthly premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit is $97.10 and requires a $226 deductible upon registration. After meeting the deductible, the individual must pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for immunosuppressive drugs.
