This is a set of unit tests for a solidity smart contract that implements the conditions described in the insurance policy document. The tests check the conditions for transplant coverage, immunosuppressive drug coverage, Medicare plan enrollment, coverage end after kidney transplant, benefit after Part A coverage ends, benefit coverage, benefit signup after Part A ends, monthly premium and deductible, and payment after deductible.
