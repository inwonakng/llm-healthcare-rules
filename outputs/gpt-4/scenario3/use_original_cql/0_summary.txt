1. Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant.
2. The policy holder must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant.
3. The policy holder must have Part B at the time they get immunosuppressive drugs.
4. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B (as mentioned in requirement 3) doesn’t cover them.
5. If the policy holder has Original Medicare, they may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
6. If the policy holder only has Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), their Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
7. Medicare offers a benefit that may help the policy holder if they lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant, and they don’t have certain types of other health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs).
8. This benefit only covers immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services.
9. This benefit isn’t a substitute for full health coverage.
10. If the policy holder qualifies, they can sign up for this benefit any time after their Part A coverage ends.
11. To sign up for this benefit, the policy holder needs to call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788.
12. In 2023, the policy holder will pay a monthly premium of $97.10 and $226 deductible if they sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit.
13. Once the policy holder has met the deductible, they will pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for their immunosuppressive drugs.
