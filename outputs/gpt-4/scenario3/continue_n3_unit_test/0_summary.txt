1. Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant.
2. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant.
3. You must have Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs.
4. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B (requirement 3) doesn’t cover them.
5. If you have Original Medicare, you may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
6. If you only have Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
7. Medicare offers a benefit that may help you, if you lose Part A coverage (requirement 2) 36 months after a kidney transplant, and you don’t have certain types of other health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs).
8. This benefit only covers your immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services.
9. It isn’t a substitute for full health coverage.
10. If you qualify, you can sign up for this benefit any time after your Part A coverage (requirement 2) ends.
11. To sign up, call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788.
12. In 2023, you’ll pay a monthly premium of $97.10 and $226 deductible if you sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit.
13. Once you’ve met the deductible, you’ll pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.
