1. Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if it contributed to the payment for the organ transplant operation.
2. To qualify, one must have been enrolled in Part A at the time of the covered transplant, and Part B at the time of receiving immunosuppressive drugs.
3. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) pays for immunosuppressive drugs if Part B doesn't cover them.
4. Individuals with Original Medicare have the option to join a Medicare drug plan to receive Medicare drug coverage.
5. For those only with Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, concludes 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
6. A benefit by Medicare is available for individuals who lose Part A coverage 36 months post kidney transplant if they don't possess certain other health coverages (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid) that cover immunosuppressive drugs.
7. This benefit exclusively covers immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services. It does not function as a full health coverage.
8. Qualifications allow for signing up for this benefit anytime after Part A coverage ends, which can be done by contacting Social Security at the provided numbers.
9. In 2023, monthly premiums for the immunosuppressive drug benefit will be $97.10 with a $226 deductible. Once the deductible is met, 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these drugs will be paid by the participant.
