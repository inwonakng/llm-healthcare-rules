1. Medicare covers the cost of transplant drug therapy if it aided in the payment of the patient's organ transplant. 
2. To qualify, the patient must have enrolled in Medicare Part A at the time of the transplant and Part B when receiving immunosuppressive drugs. 
3. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) provides coverage for immunosuppressive drugs in instances where Part B does not ensure coverage.
4. If the patient has the basic, Original Medicare, they have the option to join a Medicare drug plan to receive this coverage, as mentioned in requirement 3.
5. For patients who only have Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), their Medicare coverage, including that for immunosuppressive drugs, will be terminated 36 months after a successful kidney transplant. 
6. Medicare provides a specific benefit for these patients, if they lose Part A coverage after 36 months of a kidney transplant, and don't have other types of health coverage such as a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that includes immunosuppressive drugs. 
7. This benefit mentioned in requirement 6 only provides coverage for immunosuppressive drugs and does not substitute full health coverage. 
8. Once patients qualify, they can enroll for this benefit anytime after their Part A coverage ends by calling the Social Security office. 
9. In 2023, the estimated monthly premium for patients enrolled in the immunosuppressive drug benefit will be $97.10, along with a $226 deductible.
10. After meeting the deductible, patients are required to pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for their immunosuppressive drugs.
