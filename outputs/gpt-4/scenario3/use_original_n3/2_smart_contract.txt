This smart contract represents the Medicare insurance policy. It includes a struct `Patient` to store the patient's information and a mapping `patients` to associate each patient with an address. The contract includes functions to sign up for the immunosuppressive benefit, pay the premium, pay the deductible, and pay for drugs. Each function includes the necessary conditions from the policy document. The contract uses the `require` function to enforce these conditions. If a condition is not met, the function call will fail and revert all changes.
