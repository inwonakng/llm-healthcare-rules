This Solidity contract abstracts and implements some of the natural language criteria described in the text, such as eligibility for different parts of the Medicare coverage. The `startMedicare` function sets up the patient details. The `activatePartD` and `joinMedicareDrugPlan` functions allow the patient to activate additional coverage. The `signUpForImmunosuppressiveBenefit` checks their eligibility and deducts the necessary funds. Patients details are stored in a mapping which maps the patient's addresses to Patient struct. The cost values premium and deductible are represented as Wei values in the smart contract. Information of all patients are stored on-chain. This simplifies the task of handling and validating patient inputs as per the text's conditions.
