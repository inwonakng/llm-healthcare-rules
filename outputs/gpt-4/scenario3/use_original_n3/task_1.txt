1. Medicare will provide coverage for transplant drug therapy as long as it has contributed towards the cost of your organ transplant.
2. To receive coverage for the transplant, you are required to possess Part A of Medicare at the time of the transplant. 
3. To receive immunosuppressive drugs, you must have Part B at the initiation of the treatment. 
4. However, if Part B does not cover it, the Medicare drug coverage, Part D, will provide coverage for the immunosuppressive drugs.
5. To receive this coverage, those who possess Original Medicare can join a Medicare drug plan.
6. If you only possess Medicare due to an End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage will conclude 36 months after a successful kidney transplant - this includes the coverage for immunosuppressive drugs.
7. If you lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant and you don't possess certain types of other health coverage, Medicare has a benefit to cover your immunosuppressive drugs. However, this benefit only covers these drugs and not other health-related items or services.
8. This benefit can be utilized any time after the termination of your Part A coverage. Simply call the Social Security number provided.
9. For the year 2023, there will be a monthly premium of $97.10 and a $226 deductible for the immunosuppressive drug benefit.
10. After fulfilling the deductible, you will then be responsible for 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.
