1. Medicare will cover transplant drug therapy if the recipient had Medicare at the time of their organ transplant. 
2. The patient must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant, and Part B when receiving immunosuppressive drugs.
3. If Part B does not cover the immunosuppressive drugs, Part D does cover them. 
4. Patients with Original Medicare have the option to join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
5. For patients who only have Medicare due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), their Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, will end 36 months after a successful kidney transplant- as specified in requirement 4.
6. Medicare provides a benefit to help patients who lose their coverage 36 months after their kidney transplant and do not have certain types of health coverage like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs. 
7. This benefit only covers immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services- it is not a substitute for full health coverage. 
8. Qualified patients can sign up for this benefit at any time after their Part A coverage ends; they can contact Social Security to sign up.
9. In 2023, subscribing to the immunosuppressive drug benefit will require a monthly premium of $97.10 and a $226 deductible. 
10. Having met the deductible, the patient will then pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the immunosuppressive drugs.
