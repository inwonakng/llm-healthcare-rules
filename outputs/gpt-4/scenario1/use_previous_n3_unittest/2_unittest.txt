In the above tests, we are assuming that the `MedicareContract` contract has the following methods:

- `checkEligibility(bool isWoman, bool hasOsteoporosis)` - checks if the patient is a woman with osteoporosis who qualifies for the Medicare home health benefit.
- `checkBoneFracture(bool hasBoneFracture)` - checks if the patient has a bone fracture that a doctor certifies is related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
- `checkSelfAdministerAbility(bool canSelfAdminister)` - checks if the patient is unable to self-administer the injection or learn how to do so.
- `checkHomeHealthNurseCoverage(bool needsNurse, bool familyCanAdminister)` - checks if Medicare will cover the services of a home health nurse or aide to administer the injection if the patient's family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to do so.
