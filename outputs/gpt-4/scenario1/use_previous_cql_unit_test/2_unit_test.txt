In this example, the `MedicareContract` is the contract that would contain the logic for the insurance policy. The `MedicareContractTest` is the test contract that tests the conditions of the insurance policy. The `beforeEach` function is used to setup a new instance of the `MedicareContract` before each test. The `checkWomanWithOsteoporosisTest`, `checkBoneFractureTest`, `checkSelfAdministerTest`, and `checkFamilyAdministerTest` functions are the unit tests for each condition of the insurance policy. The `Assert.equal` function is used to check if the result of the condition is as expected.
