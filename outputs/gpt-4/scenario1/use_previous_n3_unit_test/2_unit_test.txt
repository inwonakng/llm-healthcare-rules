This test suite assumes the existence of an `InsurancePolicy` contract with two functions: `isCovered` and `isNurseCovered`. The `isCovered` function takes four boolean parameters representing the four conditions in the policy summary. The `isNurseCovered` function takes a single boolean parameter representing whether the beneficiary's family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug by injection.
