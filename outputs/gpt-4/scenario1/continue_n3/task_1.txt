Summary:
Medicare's coverage conditions for injectable osteoporosis drugs are provided as follows:

1. The beneficiary is a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
2. The beneficiary has a bone fracture that a doctor certifies was related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
3. The beneficiary's doctor certifies that the patient cannot self-administer the injection or learn how to do so.
4. Medicare will extend coverage to include a home health nurse or aide to administer the injection if the patient's family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug. Given such a condition, if the patient can't self-administer or the caregivers aren't suitable, provision of a healthcare worker is ensured.
