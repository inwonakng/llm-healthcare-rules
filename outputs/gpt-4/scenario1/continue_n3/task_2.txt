Based on the provided conversation, the N3 logic rules can be expressed as follows:

```
{
    ?patient a :Woman.
    ?patient :hasCondition :Osteoporosis.
    ?patient :meetsCriteria :MedicareHomeHealthBenefit.
    ?patient :hasCertificateDoctor :BoneFractureRelatedPostMenopauseOsteoporosis.
    ?patient :hasCertificateDoctor :CannotSelfAdministerInjection.
} => {
    ?patient :EligibleMedicareCoverage :InjectableOsteoporosisDrug.
}.

{
    ?patient :EligibleMedicareCoverage :InjectableOsteoporosisDrug.
    ?caregiver :CannotORUnwillingAdministerInjection true.
} => {
    ?patient :MedicareCoverageIncludes :HomeHealthNurseORaideInjection.
}.
```
In these logic rules:

- `:Woman`, `:Osteoporosis`, `:MedicareHomeHealthBenefit`, `:BoneFractureRelatedPostMenopauseOsteoporosis`, and `:CannotSelfAdministerInjection` denote conditions.
- `:hasCondition`, `:meetsCriteria`, and `:hasCertificateDoctor` denote the relationship between the patient and different conditions.
- `:EligibleMedicareCoverage` is used to determine the eligibility of the patient for the medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs.
- `:CannotORUnwillingAdministerInjection` denotes the inability or unwillingness of a caregiver to administer injection.
- `:MedicareCoverageIncludes` is used to determine the provision of a home health nurse or aide injection under Medicare coverage.
- The final decision about the eligibility of a patient for Medicare coverage and its extensions are represented by `:EligibleMedicareCoverage` and `:MedicareCoverageIncludes` predicates respectively.
- `?patient` and `?caregiver` are variables representing a patient and a caregiver respectively.
