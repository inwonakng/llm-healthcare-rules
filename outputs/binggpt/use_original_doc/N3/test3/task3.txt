Here's a Solidity smart contract that follows the given natural language text:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareTransplantCoverage {
    struct MedicareCoverage {
        bool partA; // Whether the beneficiary has Part A coverage
        bool partB; // Whether the beneficiary has Part B coverage
        bool partD; // Whether the beneficiary has Part D coverage
        bool originalMedicare; // Whether the beneficiary has Original Medicare
        bool esrd; // Whether the beneficiary has End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
        bool successfulTransplant; // Whether the beneficiary had a successful kidney transplant
        bool lostPartACoverage; // Whether the beneficiary lost Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant
        bool noOtherHealthCoverage; // Whether the beneficiary has certain types of other health coverage

        bool isEligibleForBenefit; // Whether the beneficiary is eligible for the immunosuppressive drug benefit
        bool hasSignedUp; // Whether the beneficiary has signed up for the benefit
        bool isQualified; // Whether the beneficiary qualifies for the benefit

        bool isActive; // Whether the beneficiary's coverage is currently active
        uint coverageEndTimestamp; // Timestamp when the beneficiary's coverage ends

        uint monthlyPremium; // Monthly premium amount
        uint deductible; // Deductible amount
        uint coinsuranceRate; // Coinsurance rate for immunosuppressive drugs
    }

    mapping(address => MedicareCoverage) public beneficiaries;

    constructor() {
        beneficiaries[msg.sender].isActive = true; // Assuming the deployer of the contract is a beneficiary
    }

    function enrollForBenefit() external {
        MedicareCoverage storage coverage = beneficiaries[msg.sender];

        require(coverage.partA, "Must have Part A coverage");
        require(coverage.successfulTransplant, "Must have had a successful kidney transplant");

        coverage.isEligibleForBenefit = true;
    }

    function signUpForBenefit() external {
        MedicareCoverage storage coverage = beneficiaries[msg.sender];

        require(coverage.isEligibleForBenefit, "Not eligible for the benefit");

        coverage.hasSignedUp = true;
    }

    function qualifyForBenefit() external {
        MedicareCoverage storage coverage = beneficiaries[msg.sender];

        require(coverage.hasSignedUp, "Must have signed up for the benefit");
        require(coverage.lostPartACoverage, "Must have lost Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant");
        require(!coverage.noOtherHealthCoverage, "Must not have certain types of other health coverage");

        coverage.isQualified = true;
    }

    function endCoverage() external {
        MedicareCoverage storage coverage = beneficiaries[msg.sender];

        coverage.isActive = false;
        coverage.coverageEndTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    }

    function calculateCost(uint totalAmount) external view returns (uint) {
        MedicareCoverage storage coverage = beneficiaries[msg.sender];

        require(coverage.isActive, "Coverage is not active");

        if (totalAmount <= coverage.deductible) {
            return totalAmount; // No coinsurance required
        } else {
            uint coinsuranceAmount = (totalAmount - coverage.deductible) * coverage.coinsuranceRate / 100;
            return coverage.deductible + coinsuranceAmount;
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified implementation that focuses on the logic described in the text. Some details, such as phone number validation and error messages, are omitted for brevity. Additionally, the smart contract assumes that the caller's address represents the beneficiary.
