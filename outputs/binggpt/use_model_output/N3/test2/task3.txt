To convert the given N3 logic rules into a Solidity smart contract, we can create a contract that includes the necessary parameters and conditions described in the rules. Here's an example implementation:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareContract {
    struct Patient {
        bool hasDiagnosis;
        bool hasDoctor;
        bool deemsMedicallyAppropriate;
        bool isCovered;
    }

    struct Benefit {
        bool isCoveredUnderPartB;
        bool doesNotCover;
    }

    mapping(address => Patient) public patients;
    mapping(address => Benefit) public benefits;

    function addPatient(
        address patientAddress,
        bool _hasDiagnosis,
        bool _hasDoctor,
        bool _deemsMedicallyAppropriate
    ) external {
        patients[patientAddress] = Patient({
            hasDiagnosis: _hasDiagnosis,
            hasDoctor: _hasDoctor,
            deemsMedicallyAppropriate: _deemsMedicallyAppropriate,
            isCovered: false
        });

        benefits[patientAddress] = Benefit({
            isCoveredUnderPartB: false,
            doesNotCover: false
        });
    }

    function checkCoverage(address patientAddress) external {
        Patient storage patient = patients[patientAddress];
        Benefit storage benefit = benefits[patientAddress];

        if (patient.hasDiagnosis) {
            patient.isCovered = true;
        }

        if (patient.hasDiagnosis && patient.hasDoctor && patient.deemsMedicallyAppropriate) {
            patient.isCovered = true;
        }

        if (patient.isCovered) {
            benefit.isCoveredUnderPartB = true;
            benefit.doesNotCover = true;
        }
    }
}
```

In this Solidity smart contract, we define two structs: `Patient` and `Benefit`, which encapsulate the necessary parameters. The `patients` and `benefits` mappings store the patient and benefit information respectively.

The `addPatient` function is used to add a patient to the contract and initialize their parameters.

The `checkCoverage` function checks the coverage conditions based on the N3 logic rules. It sets the `isCovered` flag for the patient based on the diagnosis and doctor's evaluation. If the patient is covered, it also sets the `isCoveredUnderPartB` and `doesNotCover` flags for the benefit.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation to demonstrate the conversion of N3 logic rules into a Solidity smart contract. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to modify the contract accordingly.
