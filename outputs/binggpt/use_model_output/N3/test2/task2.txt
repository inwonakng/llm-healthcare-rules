The decision process and requirements can be translated into the following logic rules in N3 syntax:

```n3
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix med: <http://example.com/medicare#> .

# Rule 1: Medicare covers IVIG for individuals with a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease.
{ ?patient rdf:type med:Patient .
  ?patient med:hasDiagnosis med:PrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease } =>
{ ?patient med:isCovered rdf:type med:CoveredBenefit } .

# Rule 2: IVIG must be deemed medically appropriate for home administration by a doctor.
{ ?patient rdf:type med:Patient .
  ?patient med:hasDiagnosis med:PrimaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease .
  ?patient med:hasDoctor ?doctor .
  ?doctor med:deemsMedicallyAppropriate ?patient } =>
{ ?patient med:isCovered rdf:type med:CoveredBenefit } .

# Rule 3: Part B of Medicare covers the cost of IVIG.
{ ?patient med:isCovered rdf:type med:CoveredBenefit } =>
{ ?patient med:isCoveredUnderPartB rdf:type med:CoveredBenefit } .

# Rule 4: Medicare does not cover the expenses of other items and services related to receiving IVIG at home.
{ ?patient med:isCovered rdf:type med:CoveredBenefit } =>
{ ?patient med:doesNotCover rdf:type med:NotCoveredBenefit } .
```

These logic rules capture the requirements and the decision process described in the given information. The rules state that if a patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease and their doctor deems IVIG medically appropriate for home administration, then Medicare covers IVIG as a covered benefit. Additionally, the rules specify that IVIG coverage falls under Part B of Medicare, and other items and services related to receiving IVIG at home are not covered.
