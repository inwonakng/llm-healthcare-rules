This N3 syntax document defines the following entities and their relationships:

* `IVIG`: A Medicare-covered service that is intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) provided in a home setting.
* `PartB`: An insurance policy that covers IVIG.
* `primaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease`: A diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease.
* `home`: A location where IVIG is administered.
* `otherItemsAndServices`: Services and items related to IVIG that are not covered by PartB.
* `MedicareCoveredService`: A service that is covered by Medicare.
* `InsurancePolicy`: A policy that governs the coverage of services and items.
* `Diagnosis`: A medical condition that is used to determine coverage.
* `Location`: A place where a service is provided.
* `Service`: An activity that is provided to a patient.

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

* `IVIG` has a diagnosis of `primaryImmuneDeficiencyDisease`.
* `IVIG` is medically appropriate for administration in a `home` setting.
* `PartB` covers `IVIG`.
* `PartB` does not pay for `otherItemsAndServices`.

This set of logical rules captures the requirements described in the insurance policy document, and can be used to make decisions about coverage for IVIG in a home setting based on the patient's diagnosis and other factors.
