Certainly! Here is a basic Solidity smart contract that implements the functionality we discussed earlier:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    address private owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can deposit");
        balance += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return balance;
    }
}
```
This contract has a `balance` variable that keeps track of the total amount of Ether deposited into the contract. The `deposit` function allows the owner to deposit Ether into the contract, and the `withdraw` function allows the owner to withdraw Ether from the contract. The `getBalance` function allows anyone to view the current balance of the contract.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may want to add additional functionality or security measures to your contract depending on your specific use case.
