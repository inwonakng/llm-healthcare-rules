Sure, here is a set of Solidity unit tests based on the previous conversation:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "remix_tests.sol"; // injected by Remix

contract MyContract {
    function myFunction() public {
        // ...
    }
}

contract TestMyContract {
    function testMyFunction() public {
        MyContract myContract = new MyContract();
        myContract.myFunction();
        // ...
    }
}
```
This is just a basic example of how you can write unit tests for a Solidity contract using the `remix_tests.sol` library. You can add more tests as needed to cover all the functionality of your contract.
