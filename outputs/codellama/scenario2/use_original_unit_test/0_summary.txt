Here is a summary of the requirements for Medicare coverage of Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) provided in the home:

1. The patient must have a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease.
2. The patient's doctor must determine that it is medically appropriate for the patient to receive IVIG in their home.
3. Medicare covers the IVIG itself, but does not pay for other items and services related to the patient receiving IVIG at home.
