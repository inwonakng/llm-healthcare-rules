2. Patient's doctor determines that it is medically appropriate for the patient to receive IVIG in their home.
3. Medicare covers the IVIG itself, but does not pay for other items and services related to the patient receiving IVIG at home.

# Logic Rules

1. If patient has primary immune deficiency disease, then Medicare covers IVIG.
2. If patient's doctor determines that IVIG is medically appropriate for patient's home, then Medicare covers IVIG.
3. If Medicare covers IVIG, then Medicare does not pay for other items and services related to patient receiving IVIG at home.

# Final Decision

If all three requirements are met, then Medicare covers IVIG provided in the home.
