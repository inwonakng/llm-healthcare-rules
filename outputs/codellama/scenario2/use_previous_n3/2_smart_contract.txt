Here is a sample Solidity smart contract that implements the requirements and logic rules described in the summary and N3 logic rules:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareIVIG {
    struct Patient {
        address patientAddress;
        string diagnosis;
        bool doctorApproval;
    }

    mapping(address => Patient) public patients;

    function addPatient(address patientAddress, string memory diagnosis, bool doctorApproval) public {
        patients[patientAddress] = Patient(patientAddress, diagnosis, doctorApproval);
    }

    function isCovered(address patientAddress) public view returns (bool) {
        Patient memory patient = patients[patientAddress];
        if (patient.diagnosis == "primary immune deficiency disease" && patient.doctorApproval) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    function isNotCovered(address patientAddress) public view returns (bool) {
        Patient memory patient = patients[patientAddress];
        if (patient.diagnosis != "primary immune deficiency disease" || !patient.doctorApproval) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
This contract defines a `Patient` struct to encapsulate the necessary parameters for a patient, including their address, diagnosis, and doctor approval. It also defines a mapping from patient addresses to `Patient` structs, which allows the contract to store and retrieve patient information.

The contract has three functions:

* `addPatient`: This function allows the contract owner to add a new patient to the contract. It takes the patient's address, diagnosis, and doctor approval as input and adds the patient to the mapping.
* `isCovered`: This function checks whether a patient is covered by Medicare for IVIG provided in their home. It takes the patient's address as input and returns `true` if the patient has a diagnosis of "primary immune deficiency disease" and their doctor has approved IVIG for home use.
* `isNotCovered`: This function checks whether a patient is not covered by Medicare for IVIG provided in their home. It takes the patient's address as input and returns `true` if the patient does not have a diagnosis of "primary immune deficiency disease" or their doctor has not approved IVIG for home use.

The contract uses the `isCovered` and `isNotCovered` functions to determine whether a patient is covered by Medicare for IVIG provided in their home. If a patient is covered, the contract returns `true` for the `isCovered` function and `false` for the `isNotCovered` function. If a patient is not covered, the contract returns `false` for the `isCovered` function and `true` for the `isNotCovered` function.

Note that this is just a sample contract and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of your use case. Additionally, it is important to review the policy document for the most up-to-date and accurate information on Medicare coverage of IVIG provided in the home.
