Certainly! Here is a basic Solidity smart contract that implements the requirements for Medicare coverage of Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) provided in the home:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareIVIG {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public primaryImmuneDeficiency;
    mapping(address => bool) public medicallyAppropriate;
    mapping(address => bool) public ivigCovered;
    mapping(address => bool) public otherItemsServicesCovered;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setPrimaryImmuneDeficiency(address patient, bool value) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set primary immune deficiency");
        primaryImmuneDeficiency[patient] = value;
    }

    function setMedicallyAppropriate(address patient, bool value) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set medically appropriate");
        medicallyAppropriate[patient] = value;
    }

    function setIVIGCovered(address patient, bool value) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set IVIG covered");
        ivigCovered[patient] = value;
    }

    function setOtherItemsServicesCovered(address patient, bool value) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set other items and services covered");
        otherItemsServicesCovered[patient] = value;
    }

    function getFinalDecision(address patient) public view returns (bool) {
        return primaryImmuneDeficiency[patient] && medicallyAppropriate[patient] && ivigCovered[patient] && otherItemsServicesCovered[patient];
    }
}
```
This contract has a few key features:

* It uses a mapping to store the patient's information, including their primary immune deficiency diagnosis, whether the IVIG is medically appropriate, whether the IVIG is covered, and whether other items and services are covered.
* It has a constructor function that sets the owner of the contract.
* It has four functions to set the values of the mappings: `setPrimaryImmuneDeficiency`, `setMedicallyAppropriate`, `setIVIGCovered`, and `setOtherItemsServicesCovered`. These functions can only be called by the owner of the contract.
* It has a `getFinalDecision` function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the patient meets the requirements for Medicare coverage of IVIG provided in their home. This function can be called by anyone.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you should thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to the mainnet.
