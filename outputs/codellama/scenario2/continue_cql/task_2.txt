In this CQL library, the named expressions are grouped into sections based on the requirements listed in the natural language text. Each named expression defines a specific concept or component of the Medicare coverage determination process for IVIG administration in the home. The final decision is determined by the intersection of the Medicare coverage, Medicare Part B coverage, eligibility for Medicare Part B coverage, primary source of payment, secondary source of payment, programmatic determination, and final decision.
