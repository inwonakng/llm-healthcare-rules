Sure, here is a set of N3 logic rules based on the previous conversation:

1. If the patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, then Medicare covers IVIG.
2. If the patient's doctor determines that it is medically appropriate for the patient to receive IVIG in their home, then Medicare covers IVIG.
3. If the patient receives IVIG in their home, then Medicare does not cover other items and services related to the patient receiving IVIG at home.

Note: These rules are based on the information provided in the previous conversation and may not be a comprehensive set of rules for all situations. It is important to review the policy document for the most up-to-date and accurate information.
