Sure, here is a set of Solidity unit tests based on the previous conversation:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "remix_tests.sol"; // injected by Remix

contract MyContract {
    function myFunction() public {
        // ...
    }
}

contract TestMyContract {
    function testMyFunction() public {
        MyContract myContract = new MyContract();
        myContract.myFunction();
        // ...
    }
}
```
This is just a basic example, you can add more tests and assertions as needed.
Also, you can use the `remix_tests.sol` library to write your tests, it provides a simple way to write and run tests for your Solidity contracts.

You can also use the `truffle` framework to write and run your tests, it provides a more comprehensive testing framework for Solidity contracts.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
