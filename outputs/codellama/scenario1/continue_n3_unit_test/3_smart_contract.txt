Certainly! Here is a basic Solidity smart contract that implements the functionality we discussed:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InsuranceCoverage {
    // Define the struct for the patient
    struct Patient {
        string name;
        uint age;
        bool gender;
        bool hasBoneFracture;
        bool isPostMenopausal;
        bool isHomeHealthBenefit;
    }

    // Define the struct for the coverage
    struct Coverage {
        string name;
        uint cost;
        bool isCovered;
    }

    // Define the mapping for the patients
    mapping(address => Patient) public patients;

    // Define the mapping for the coverages
    mapping(string => Coverage) public coverages;

    // Define the function to add a patient
    function addPatient(string memory _name, uint _age, bool _gender, bool _hasBoneFracture, bool _isPostMenopausal, bool _isHomeHealthBenefit) public {
        patients[msg.sender] = Patient(_name, _age, _gender, _hasBoneFracture, _isPostMenopausal, _isHomeHealthBenefit);
    }

    // Define the function to add a coverage
    function addCoverage(string memory _name, uint _cost, bool _isCovered) public {
        coverages[_name] = Coverage(_name, _cost, _isCovered);
    }

    // Define the function to check if a patient is covered
    function isCovered(address _patient) public view returns (bool) {
        Patient memory patient = patients[_patient];
        if (patient.isHomeHealthBenefit && patient.hasBoneFracture && patient.isPostMenopausal) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Define the function to get the cost of a coverage
    function getCost(string memory _name) public view returns (uint) {
        Coverage memory coverage = coverages[_name];
        return coverage.cost;
    }
}
```
This contract has the following functions:

* `addPatient`: Adds a new patient to the contract with the specified name, age, gender, bone fracture status, and home health benefit status.
* `addCoverage`: Adds a new coverage to the contract with the specified name, cost, and covered status.
* `isCovered`: Checks if a patient is covered based on their information.
* `getCost`: Gets the cost of a coverage based on its name.

Note that this is just a basic example and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of your use case. Additionally, this contract does not include any security measures, such as access control or input validation, and should not be used in a production environment without proper security considerations.
