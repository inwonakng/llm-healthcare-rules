Medicare covers injectable osteoporosis drugs based on various conditions. Here are the requirements explained in a numbered list format:

1. You are a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
2. You have a bone fracture that a doctor certifies was related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
3. Your doctor certifies that you can't give yourself the injection or learn how to give yourself the drug by injection.
4. Medicare will cover the home health nurse or aide to provide the injection if your family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to give you the drug by injection.

It is important to note that these requirements must be met in order for Medicare to cover the cost of injectable osteoporosis drugs. If you are unsure about whether you meet these requirements, it is best to consult with your healthcare provider or a Medicare representative for further clarification.
