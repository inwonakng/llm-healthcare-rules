Summary:
This text refers to Medicare coverage for injectable osteoporosis drugs. To be eligible, you must be a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit, have a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis, and meet certain requirements related to obtaining the injection. If your family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to give you the injection, Medicare will cover the cost of a home health nurse or aide to administer the medication.

1. Be a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
2. Have a bone fracture that a doctor certifies was related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
3. Meet certain requirements related to obtaining the injection, including a doctor's certification that you can't give yourself the injection or learn how to do so.
4. If necessary, have a home health nurse or aide provide the injection.

Final decision:
If you meet all of the above requirements and receive the injection, Medicare will cover the cost.
