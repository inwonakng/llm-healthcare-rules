Sure, here is a set of CQL named expressions based on the previous conversation:

1. `IsFemale`: `true` if the patient is female, `false` otherwise.
2. `HasOsteoporosis`: `true` if the patient has osteoporosis, `false` otherwise.
3. `HasBoneFracture`: `true` if the patient has a bone fracture, `false` otherwise.
4. `FractureRelatedToOsteoporosis`: `true` if the patient's bone fracture is related to osteoporosis, `false` otherwise.
5. `CanSelfAdministerDrug`: `true` if the patient can self-administer the drug, `false` otherwise.
6. `HasCaregiver`: `true` if the patient has a caregiver, `false` otherwise.
7. `CaregiverUnwillingOrUnableToAdministerDrug`: `true` if the patient's caregiver is unwilling or unable to administer the drug, `false` otherwise.
8. `MedicareCoverage`: `true` if the patient is covered by Medicare, `false` otherwise.
9. `InjectableOsteoporosisDrugCoverage`: `true` if the patient's injectable osteoporosis drug is covered by Medicare, `false` otherwise.

These named expressions can be used to create a CQL library that captures the requirements for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs.
