Here is a possible implementation of the smart contract in Solidity version 0.8.0:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareCoverage {
    struct Coverage {
        bool isCovered;
        bool isWoman;
        bool hasOsteoporosis;
        bool meetsHomeHealthBenefitCriteria;
        bool hasFracture;
        bool isRelatedToPostMenopausalOsteoporosis;
        bool hasCertification;
        bool canNotGiveInjection;
        bool canNotLearnInjection;
    }

    function isCovered(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.isCovered;
    }

    function isWoman(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.isWoman;
    }

    function hasOsteoporosis(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.hasOsteoporosis;
    }

    function meetsHomeHealthBenefitCriteria(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.meetsHomeHealthBenefitCriteria;
    }

    function hasFracture(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.hasFracture;
    }

    function isRelatedToPostMenopausalOsteoporosis(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.isRelatedToPostMenopausalOsteoporosis;
    }

    function hasCertification(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.hasCertification;
    }

    function canNotGiveInjection(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.canNotGiveInjection;
    }

    function canNotLearnInjection(Coverage coverage) public view returns (bool) {
        return coverage.canNotLearnInjection;
    }
}
```
This smart contract defines a struct `Coverage` that encapsulates the necessary parameters for determining Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs. The struct has the following fields:

* `isCovered`: a boolean indicating whether the patient is covered by Medicare
* `isWoman`: a boolean indicating whether the patient is a woman
* `hasOsteoporosis`: a boolean indicating whether the patient has osteoporosis
* `meetsHomeHealthBenefitCriteria`: a boolean indicating whether the patient meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit
* `hasFracture`: a boolean indicating whether the patient has a bone fracture
* `isRelatedToPostMenopausalOsteoporosis`: a boolean indicating whether the patient's bone fracture is related to post-menopausal osteoporosis
* `hasCertification`: a boolean indicating whether the patient has a certification from a doctor that they can't give themselves the injection or learn how to give themselves the drug by injection
* `canNotGiveInjection`: a boolean indicating whether the patient can't give themselves the injection
* `canNotLearnInjection`: a boolean indicating whether the patient can't learn how to give themselves the drug by injection

The smart contract also defines several functions that can be used to query the `Coverage` struct and determine whether the patient is covered by Medicare. These functions include:

* `isCovered`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient is covered by Medicare
* `isWoman`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient is a woman
* `hasOsteoporosis`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient has osteoporosis
* `meetsHomeHealthBenefitCriteria`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit
* `hasFracture`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient has a bone fracture
* `isRelatedToPostMenopausalOsteoporosis`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient's bone fracture is related to post-menopausal osteoporosis
* `hasCertification`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient has a certification from a doctor that they can't give themselves the injection or learn how to give themselves the drug by injection
* `canNotGiveInjection`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient can't give themselves the injection
* `canNotLearnInjection`: returns a boolean indicating whether the patient can't learn how to give themselves the drug by injection

Note that this is just one possible implementation of the smart contract, and there may be other ways to implement the logic described in the summary and N3 rules.
