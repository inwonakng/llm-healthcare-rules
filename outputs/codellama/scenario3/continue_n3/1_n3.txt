Certainly! Here are some N3 logic rules based on the previous conversation:

1. If a patient has Part A at the time of the covered transplant, and they have Part B at the time they get immunosuppressive drugs, then Medicare covers the immunosuppressive drug benefit.
2. If a patient has Original Medicare, they may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
3. If a patient only has Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), their Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
4. If a patient loses Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant, and they don't have certain types of other health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs), then Medicare offers a benefit that may help them.
5. The Medicare benefit that may help a patient covers their immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services. It isn't a substitute for full health coverage.
6. A patient can sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit any time after their Part A coverage ends.
7. To sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit, a patient should call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788.
8. In 2023, a patient will pay a monthly premium of $97.10* and a $226 deductible if they sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit.
9. Once a patient has met the deductible, they will pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for their immunosuppressive drugs.

I hope these rules are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further clarification.
