Here is a summary of the requirements for Medicare's immunosuppressive drug benefit:

1. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant, and you must have Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs.
2. If you have Original Medicare, you may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
3. If you only have Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
4. Medicare offers a benefit that may help you if you lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant, and you don’t have certain types of other health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs).
5. This benefit only covers your immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services. It isn’t a substitute for full health coverage.
6. If you qualify, you can sign up for this benefit any time after your Part A coverage ends.
7. To sign up, call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788.
8. In 2023, you’ll pay a monthly premium of $97.10* and $226 deductible if you sign up for the immunosuppressive drug benefit.
9. Once you’ve met the deductible, you’ll pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.
