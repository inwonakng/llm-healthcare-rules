Sure, here is a set of Solidity unit tests based on the previous conversation:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "remix_tests.sol"; // import the Remix unit testing library

contract MedicareTest {
    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct name
    function testMedicareName() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.name(), "Medicare", "Medicare contract should have the correct name");
    }

    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct number of Part A and Part B plans
    function testMedicarePlans() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.partAPlans.length, 10, "Medicare contract should have 10 Part A plans");
        Assert.equal(medicare.partBPlans.length, 10, "Medicare contract should have 10 Part B plans");
    }

    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct number of immunosuppressive drug plans
    function testImmunosuppressiveDrugPlans() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.immunosuppressiveDrugPlans.length, 10, "Medicare contract should have 10 immunosuppressive drug plans");
    }

    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct number of Part A and Part B plans for a specific state
    function testMedicarePlansForState() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.partAPlansForState("CA").length, 2, "Medicare contract should have 2 Part A plans for California");
        Assert.equal(medicare.partBPlansForState("CA").length, 2, "Medicare contract should have 2 Part B plans for California");
    }

    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct number of immunosuppressive drug plans for a specific state
    function testImmunosuppressiveDrugPlansForState() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.immunosuppressiveDrugPlansForState("CA").length, 2, "Medicare contract should have 2 immunosuppressive drug plans for California");
    }

    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct number of Part A and Part B plans for a specific zip code
    function testMedicarePlansForZipCode() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.partAPlansForZipCode("90210").length, 2, "Medicare contract should have 2 Part A plans for zip code 90210");
        Assert.equal(medicare.partBPlansForZipCode("90210").length, 2, "Medicare contract should have 2 Part B plans for zip code 90210");
    }

    // Test that the Medicare contract has the correct number of immunosuppressive drug plans for a specific zip code
    function testImmunosuppressiveDrugPlansForZipCode() public {
        Medicare medicare = new Medicare();
        Assert.equal(medicare.immunosuppressiveDrugPlansForZipCode("90210").length, 2, "Medicare contract should have 2 immunosuppressive drug plans for zip code 90210");
    }
}
```
These tests cover the following scenarios:

1. The Medicare contract has the correct name.
2. The Medicare contract has the correct number of Part A and Part B plans.
3. The Medicare contract has the correct number of immunosuppressive drug plans.
4. The Medicare contract has the correct number of Part A and Part B plans for a specific state.
5. The Medicare contract has the correct number of immunosuppressive drug plans for a specific state.
6. The Medicare contract has the correct number of Part A and Part B plans for a specific zip code.
7. The Medicare contract has the correct number of immunosuppressive drug plans for a specific zip code.

Note that these tests are just examples and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, you may want to add more tests to cover other scenarios, such as checking the contents of the plans or the eligibility of specific individuals.
