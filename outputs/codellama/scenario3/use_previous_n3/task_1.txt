Summary:

* Medicare covers transplant drug therapy for those who received a transplant and have Part A and Part B coverage at the time of the transplant, or at the time of receiving immunosuppressive drugs.
* If a patient has only ESRD-related Medicare, their coverage ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
* Medicare may offer a benefit to cover immunosuppressive drugs if a patient loses Part A coverage and does not have other health coverage.
* This benefit may be signed up for any time after Part A coverage ends and is only for immunosuppressive drugs.
* The monthly premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit in 2023 is $97.10, with a $226 deductible. The patient will pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for their immunosuppressive drugs after meeting the deductible.
