Here is a summary of the text in a more comprehensible format:

1. Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant.
2. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant and Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs.
3. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B doesn’t cover them.
4. If you have Original Medicare, you may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
5. If you only have Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
6. Medicare offers a benefit that may help you if you lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant, and you don’t have certain types of other health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs).
7. This benefit only covers your immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services.
8. It isn’t a substitute for full health coverage.
9. If you qualify, you can sign up for this benefit any time after your Part A coverage ends.
10. To sign up, call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788.
11. The monthly premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit is $97.10 and the deductible is $226 for 2023.
12. If you meet the deductible, you’ll pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.
