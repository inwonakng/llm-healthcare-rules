Summary: Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant. Requirements include:

1. Having Part A at the time of the covered transplant.
2. Having Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs (Medicare drug coverage, Part D, may cover these drugs if Part B doesn't).
3. Keeping Original Medicare to join a Medicare drug plan.
4. Meeting a 36-month waiting period after a successful kidney transplant if you only have Medicare due to ESRD.
5. Losing Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant and not having other health coverage (like group health plans, TRICARE, or Medicaid that covers immunosuppressive drugs).

If you qualify for the immunosuppressive drug benefit, you can sign up anytime after your Part A coverage ends. Sign up includes paying a monthly premium of $97.10* and a $226 deductible. Once you've met the deductible, you'll pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.

*The premium amount may be higher or lower based on your income level.
