1. Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if Medicare helped pay for your organ transplant.
2. You must have Part A at the time of the covered transplant.
3. You must have Part B at the time you get immunosuppressive drugs.
4. Medicare drug coverage (Part D) covers immunosuppressive drugs if Part B doesn’t cover them.
5. If you have Original Medicare, you may join a Medicare drug plan to get Medicare drug coverage.
6. If you only have Medicare because of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), your Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
7. Medicare offers a benefit if you lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant and don’t have certain types of other health coverage. This benefit only covers your immunosuppressive drugs and no other items or services.
8. This benefit isn’t a substitute for full health coverage.
9. If you qualify for the benefit, you can sign up any time after your Part A coverage ends by calling Social Security at 1-877-465-0355. TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788.
10. In 2023, the monthly premium for the immunosuppressive drug benefit is $97.10* and there is a $226 deductible.
11. Once the deductible is met, you'll pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for your immunosuppressive drugs.
