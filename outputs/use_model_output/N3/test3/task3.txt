As a web3 developer, I will convert the given set of N3 logic rules into a Solidity smart contract. Here's an example implementation:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MedicareTransplantCoverage {
    struct Requirements {
        bool helpedPayForTransplant;
        bool hasPartACoverage;
        bool hasPartBCoverage;
        bool hasPartBCoverageImmunosuppressive;
        bool hasOriginalMedicare;
        bool coverageEndsESRD;
        bool losesPartAAfter36Months;
        bool benefitNotSubstitute;
        bool canSignUpAfterPartAEnds;
        bool callTTYUsers;
    }

    struct Costs {
        uint256 monthlyPremium;
        uint256 deductible;
        uint256 payPercentage;
    }

    function qualifyForBenefit(Requirements memory requirements) external pure returns (bool) {
        return requirements.helpedPayForTransplant &&
            requirements.hasPartACoverage &&
            requirements.hasPartBCoverage &&
            requirements.hasPartBCoverageImmunosuppressive &&
            requirements.hasOriginalMedicare &&
            requirements.coverageEndsESRD &&
            requirements.losesPartAAfter36Months &&
            requirements.benefitNotSubstitute &&
            requirements.canSignUpAfterPartAEnds &&
            requirements.callTTYUsers;
    }

    function getCosts() external pure returns (Costs memory) {
        return Costs(97.10 ether, 226 ether, 20);
    }
}
```

In this Solidity smart contract, we have two structs: `Requirements` and `Costs`. The `Requirements` struct represents the conditions described in the logic rules, and the `Costs` struct represents the costs for the immunosuppressive drug benefit.

The `qualifyForBenefit` function takes a `Requirements` object as input and checks if all the conditions are met according to the logic rules. It returns `true` if all the conditions are satisfied and `false` otherwise.

The `getCosts` function returns the costs for the immunosuppressive drug benefit as defined in the logic rules.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation, and further modifications may be required based on the specific requirements and context of your application.
