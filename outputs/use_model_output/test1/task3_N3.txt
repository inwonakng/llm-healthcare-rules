Here's a solidity smart contract that converts the given N3 logic rules into code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OsteoporosisContract {
    struct Person {
        bool isWoman;
        bool hasOsteoporosis;
        bool hasFracture;
        bool isPostMenopausal;
    }

    struct Fracture {
        bool hasRelationToOsteoporosis;
        bool hasRelationToPostMenopausal;
    }

    struct Doctor {
        CertificationType certificationType;
        address certificationSubject;
    }

    struct Caregivers {
        bool hasCapabilityToAdministerInjection;
        bool hasInabilityOrUnwillingness;
    }

    enum CertificationType {
        None,
        BoneFracture,
        InabilityToAdministerInjection
    }

    mapping(address => Person) public persons;
    mapping(address => Fracture) public fractures;
    mapping(address => Doctor) public doctors;
    mapping(address => Caregivers) public caregivers;
    mapping(address => bool) public eligibility;
    mapping(address => bool) public coverage;

    function checkEligibility(address personAddress) public {
        Person storage person = persons[personAddress];
        if (person.isWoman &&
            person.hasOsteoporosis &&
            eligibility[personAddress]) {
            eligibility[personAddress] = true;
        }
    }

    function certifyBoneFracture(address personAddress, address fractureAddress, address doctorAddress) public {
        Person storage person = persons[personAddress];
        Fracture storage fracture = fractures[fractureAddress];
        Doctor storage doctor = doctors[doctorAddress];

        if (person.isWoman &&
            person.hasOsteoporosis &&
            fracture.hasRelationToOsteoporosis &&
            fracture.hasRelationToPostMenopausal &&
            doctor.certificationType == CertificationType.BoneFracture) {
            doctor.certificationSubject = personAddress;
        }
    }

    function certifyInabilityToAdministerInjection(address personAddress, address doctorAddress) public {
        Person storage person = persons[personAddress];
        Doctor storage doctor = doctors[doctorAddress];

        if (person.isWoman &&
            person.hasOsteoporosis &&
            doctor.certificationType == CertificationType.InabilityToAdministerInjection) {
            doctor.certificationSubject = personAddress;
        }
    }

    function checkCoverage(address personAddress, address caregiverAddress) public {
        Person storage person = persons[personAddress];
        Caregivers storage caregivers = caregivers[caregiverAddress];

        if (person.isWoman &&
            person.hasOsteoporosis &&
            coverage[personAddress] &&
            caregivers.hasCapabilityToAdministerInjection) {
            caregivers.hasInabilityOrUnwillingness = true;
        }
    }
}
```

The smart contract includes structs for `Person`, `Fracture`, `Doctor`, and `Caregivers` to encapsulate the necessary parameters. It also includes mappings to store the data related to each entity, such as eligibility, coverage, and certifications. The contract provides functions to check eligibility, certify bone fracture, certify inability to administer injection, and check coverage.

Please note that the code provided is a basic implementation to demonstrate the conversion of the logic rules into a smart contract and may require further refinement based on your specific requirements and the context of your application.
