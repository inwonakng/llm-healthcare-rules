I have extracted the named expressions from the description of the decision process and the list of requirements. Here is the CQL library that covers all the requirements:

```cql
library MedicareCoverage of "Medicare Coverage for Injectable Osteoporosis Drugs"

using FHIR version '4.0.1'

define eligibleForCoverage:
  // Requirement 1: To be eligible for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs, you must be a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
  exists (
    [Condition: "Osteoporosis"]
      where subject.gender = 'female'
      and subject.birthDate before 'YYYY-01-01' -- Replace 'YYYY' with the relevant year
  ) and exists (
    [Coverage: "Medicare Home Health Benefit"]
      where beneficiary = subject
  )

define boneFractureCertified:
  // Requirement 2: A doctor must certify that you have a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
  exists (
    [Condition: "Bone Fracture"]
      where clinicalStatus = 'active'
      and onset >= 'YYYY-01-01' -- Replace 'YYYY' with the relevant year
  )

define unableToSelfAdminister:
  // Requirement 3: Your doctor must certify that you are unable to give yourself the injection or learn how to do so.
  exists (
    [Condition: "Inability to Self-Administer Injection"]
      where clinicalStatus = 'active'
      and onset >= 'YYYY-01-01' -- Replace 'YYYY' with the relevant year
  )

define homeHealthNurseOrAideCoverage:
  // Requirement 4: If your family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug by injection, Medicare will cover the cost of a home health nurse or aide to provide the injection.
  exists (
    [Coverage: "Home Health Nurse or Aide"]
      where beneficiary = subject
  )

define eligibleForCoverageDecision:
  // Decision: Determine if the individual is eligible for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs.
  eligibleForCoverage

define finalDecision:
  // Final Decision: Determine if the individual meets all the requirements for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs.
  eligibleForCoverageDecision and boneFractureCertified and unableToSelfAdminister and homeHealthNurseOrAideCoverage
```

In the above CQL library, the named expressions represent each of the requirements, and the `eligibleForCoverageDecision` named expression contributes to the final decision based on the description of the decision process. The `finalDecision` named expression combines all the requirements for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs.

Please note that you need to replace 'YYYY' with the relevant year in the expressions where indicated.
