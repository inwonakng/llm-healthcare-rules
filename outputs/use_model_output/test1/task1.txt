Summary: Medicare covers injectable osteoporosis drugs for eligible women with osteoporosis who meet certain conditions, including being eligible for the Medicare home health benefit, having a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis, and being unable to self-administer the injection or learn how to do so. Medicare will also cover a home health nurse or aide to administer the injection if family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to do so.

Requirements:

1. To be eligible for Medicare coverage of injectable osteoporosis drugs, you must be a woman with osteoporosis who meets the criteria for the Medicare home health benefit.
2. A doctor must certify that you have a bone fracture related to post-menopausal osteoporosis.
3. Your doctor must certify that you are unable to give yourself the injection or learn how to do so.
4. If your family or caregivers are unable or unwilling to administer the drug by injection, Medicare will cover the cost of a home health nurse or aide to provide the injection.
