This Smart Contract covers all the points mentioned in the natural-language text. A few assumptions have been done: 
1. The user and the caregiver must be registered before checking the coverage or the caregiver ability. 
2. The smart contract does not guarantee to cover the injectable osteoporosis drugs, but it verifies if a person is eligible for a Medicare coverage based on their conditions described in the text. The function `isCovered` will throw an exception if the user is not eligible, and returns true if they are. 
3. Similarly, the function `isCaregiverAbleToInject` will throw an exception in case caregiver is not able to administer the drugs, and returns true when they are.
4. Both the patient and the caregiver are registered with their respective features (status for the patient, ability for the caregiver) to easily manage data.
