1. Medicare covers transplant drug therapy if it also funded the organ transplant procedure.
2. To receive transplant drug therapy, it is mandatory to have Part A at the time of the transplant and Part B during the time you receive immunosuppressive drugs.
3. If Part B does not cover immunosuppressive drugs, Medicare drug coverage (Part D) will cover them.
4. For those with Original Medicare, joining a Medicare drug plan grants Medicare drug coverage.
5. If one is part of Medicare solely due to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), Medicare coverage, including immunosuppressive drug coverage, ceases 36 months after a successful kidney transplant.
6. Medicare provides a benefit for those who lose Part A coverage 36 months post a kidney transplant and if they lack other types of health coverage (like a group health plan, TRICARE, or Medicaid) that covers immunosuppressive drugs. 
    - The cited benefit only covers the cost of immunosuppressive drugs and nothing else. 
    - Although it provides coverage for drugs, it is not a full health coverage alternative.
    - If eligible, enrolment for this benefit can be done any time after one's Part A coverage ends via a phone call to Social Security.
7. In 2023, a monthly premium of $97.10 and a $226 deductible are required for the immunosuppressive drug benefit. Once the deductible is paid, you're responsible for 20% of the Medicare-approved cost for the immunosuppressive drugs.
