This Solidity smart contract creates a `Patient` struct to encapsulate necessary parameters such as Medicare parts the patient has, their health status, months after kidney transplant, registrational status for immunosuppressive drug benefit, and payment details. With the `registerPatient` method, patients are registered with their necessary details. `getTransplantDrugTherapyCoverageDetails` method checks the conditions and returns the coverage details. Patients can sign up for immunosuppressive drug benefit using `signUpForImmunosuppressiveDrugBenefit` method and they can get their bill details with the `getDetailsOfBillAfterImmunosuppressiveBenefit` method which considers the premium, deductible, and additional amount to pay for drugs. This Solidity smart contract abides by all the rules and covers all aspects of the provided natural language text.
