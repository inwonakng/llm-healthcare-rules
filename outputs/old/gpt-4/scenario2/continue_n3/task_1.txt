1. Medicare provides coverage for Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) if administered at the patient's home.
2. Coverage is conditional to a diagnosed primary immune deficiency disease.
3. The IVIG home administration must be deemed medically appropriate by the patient's doctor.
4. The patient's Medicare Part B is responsible for covering the cost of the IVIG itself.
5. Part B, however, does not cover the cost for additional items and services associated with home administration of the IVIG.
