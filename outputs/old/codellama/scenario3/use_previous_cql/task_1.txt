**Medicare Transplant Drug Coverage**

Medicare covers immunosuppressive drugs for transplant recipients if they have Part A at the time of the transplant and Part B at the time of the drugs. If Part B doesn't cover the drugs, Medicare Part D may cover them. If a patient has Original Medicare and joins a Medicare drug plan, they may be covered. However, Medicare coverage ends 36 months after a successful kidney transplant for those with ESRD. There is a benefit available for those who lose Part A coverage 36 months after a kidney transplant and don't have other health coverage, covering only immunosuppressive drugs. To sign up, call Social Security at 1-877-465-0355 (TTY users can call 1-800-325-0788). The premium is $97.10 and the deductible is $226. Once met, patients pay 20% of the Medicare-approved cost of their immunosuppressive drugs.
