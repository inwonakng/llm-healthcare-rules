In this CQL library, I defined four named expressions to cover every requirement described in the natural language text:

* `Medicare_Covers_IVIG`: This expression determines whether Medicare covers IVIG based on the patient's diagnosis and the doctor's approval.
* `Part_B_Covers_IVIG_Itself`: This expression determines whether Part B covers the IVIG itself.
* `Part_B_Covers_IVIG_Services_And_Items`: This expression determines whether Part B covers the IVIG service and items.
* `Part_B_Does_Not_Cover_IVIG_Itself`: This expression determines whether Part B does not cover the IVIG itself.

The final decision is based on the combination of these named expressions. The decision is true if Medicare covers IVIG, or if Part B covers the IVIG service and items and the patient has a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease, and the doctor approves of IVIG. Otherwise, the decision is false.

Note that the CQL library also includes a set of terms and concepts, such as `Medicare`, `IVIG`, `Primary_Immune_Deficiency_Disease`, `Doctor_Approval`, and `Part_B`, which are used to define the named expressions. These terms and concepts are defined outside of the CQL library and are assumed to be known by the system.
