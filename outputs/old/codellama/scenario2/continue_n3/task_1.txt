Summary: This text discusses Medicare coverage for Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) administered at home for individuals with primary immune deficiency diseases.

Requirements:

1. The individual must have a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease.
2. The doctor must determine that IVIG is medically necessary for the individual.
3. Medicare Part B covers the cost of the IVIG, but does not cover other expenses related to administering the IVIG at home.
4. The individual's doctor must prescribe the IVIG and monitor the individual's progress.
5. The individual must receive the IVIG at home, as Part B does not cover the costs of administering the IVIG in a medical facility.
6. The individual must have a Medicare-approved home health care provider to administer the IVIG.
7. The individual must follow the guidelines set by their doctor and home health care provider to ensure safe administration of the IVIG.
8. The individual must regularly receive updates on their primary immune deficiency disease and any related treatments.

Decision: Medicare covers IVIG when administered at home for individuals with primary immune deficiency diseases, but Part B does not cover related expenses. The individual must have a doctor's prescription, follow the guidelines set by their doctor and home health care provider, and receive regular updates on their condition.
