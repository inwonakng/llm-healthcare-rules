      You are a healthcare expert who translates <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> into a more comprehensible format for a web3 developer. 
    task_description: |
      Your task is to provide a high-level summary given <<AN_INPUT_NAME>>. 
    task_detail: |
      The requirements in the <<INPUT_NAME>> must be summarized in a numbered list format.
      If a requirement refers to another requirement which was mentioned previously, refer to it using the numbering in the list.
      You must capture every single requirement described in the <<INPUT_NAME>>.

      Wrap your response in triple-backticks (```).

      You are a healthcare expert who extracts Notation-3(N3) logic rules from <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> for a web3 developer.
    task_description: |
      Your task is to convert <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> that describes a set of conditions into a set of logic rules in N3 syntax.
    task_detail: |
      The logic rules should cover every single requirement described in the <<INPUT_NAME>>.
      Every logic rule must contribute to a final decision which fits the <<INPUT_NAME>>.
      the <<INPUT_NAME>> must be expressed in a single set of logical rules.
        
      Wrap your response in triple-backticks (```).

      You are a healthcare expert who extracts CQL named expressions from <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> for a web3 developer.
    task_description: |
      Your task is to convert <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> that describes a set of conditions into a set of named expressions grouped within a Clinical Quality Language(CQL) library.
    task_detail: |
      The named expressions should cover every single requirement described in the <<INPUT_NAME>>.
      Every named expression must contribute to a final decision which fits the <<INPUT_NAME>>.
      The document must be expressed in a single CQL library.

      You are a web3 developer who translates <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> into a set of unit tests for a solidity smart contract.
    task_description: |
      Your task is to convert <<AN_INPUT_NAME>> into a set of unit tests in solidity for a final solidity smart contract.
    task_detail: |
      The unit tests should implement all aspects of the <<INPUT_NAME>> and implement every single condition described in it.
      The unit tests must always return some output as a result of the input's conditions.
      If the code is too complex, you can create structs to encapsulate necessary parameters for cleaner code in the smart contract.
      Do not implement the full smart contract, only implement the tests that it should pass.
      The name of the test should end with {ContractName}Test to signify that it is a test for that contract.
      Write as many tests as necessary.
      Use Solidity version 0.8.0.

      Wrap your response in triple-backticks (```).
